      "{'39115687': 'OBJECTIVES: Previous evidence suggests that bisphosphonates (BPs) may lower the risk of recurrent fractures and enhance functional recovery in patients with fractures. However, there has been controversy regarding the optimal timing of treatment initiation for patients with fragility fractures. We conducted a meta-analysis to evaluate the available evidence on the use of BPs during the perioperative period and compared it to both non-perioperative periods and non-usage.\\nMETHODS: Electronic searches were performed using PubMed, EMBASE, Web of Science and the Cochrane Library published before February 2023, without any language restrictions. The primary outcomes included fracture healing rate, healing time, and new fractures. We also examined a wide range of secondary outcomes. Random effects meta-analysis was used.\\nRESULTS: A total of 19 clinical trials involving 2543 patients were included in this meta-analysis. When comparing patients with non-perioperative BPs use in 4-6 weeks and approximately 10-12 weeks post-surgically, the overall risk ratios (RRs) of perioperative BPs use for healing rate were 1.06 (95% CI: 0.81, 1.38, p=0.69) and 1.02 (95% CI: 0.94, 1.11, p=0.65), respectively, suggesting no difference in healing rate between perioperative and non-perioperative BP initiation. For healing time, the overall mean difference between perioperative and non-perioperative periods was -0.19 week (95% CI: -1.03, 0.64, p=0.65) at approximately 10-12 weeks, indicating no significant impact of perioperative BP initiation on healing time. In terms of new fractures, the overall RR with BP use was 0.35 (95% CI: 0.17-0.73, p=0.005), when compared to patients without BPs use. This suggests a protective impact of BP use against new fractures compared to patients without BP use. Perioperative BP use was associated with a markedly higher likelihood of having adverse experiences, including fever (RR: 23.78, 95% CI: 8.29, 68.21, p< 0.001), arthralgia (RR: 10.20, 95% CI: 2.41, 43.16, p=0.002), and myalgia (RR: 9.42, 95% CI: 2.54, 34.87, p< 0.001), compared with non-BPs use.\\nCONCLUSIONS: Treatment with BP during the perioperative period does not affect the healing process and has positive effects on therapy for patients with fragility fractures. These compelling findings underscore the potential efficacy of BP use during the perioperative period as a viable treatment option for patients with fragility fractures.', '39108041': None, '39102642': 'PURPOSE: Understanding the real-world experience of patients with early breast cancer (eBC) is imperative for optimizing outcomes and evolving patient care. However, there is a lack of patient-level data, hindering clinical development. This social listening study was performed to understand patient insights into symptoms and impacts of hormone therapy (HT) for eBC using posts from patient forums on breastcancer.org to inform future clinical research.\\nMETHODS: Natural language processing (NLP) and machine learning techniques were used to identify themes related to eBC from a sample of 500,000 posts. After relevant data selection, 362,074 eBC posts were retained for further analysis of symptoms and impacts related to HT, as well as insights into symptom severity, pain locations, and symptom management using exercise and yoga.\\nRESULTS: Overall, 32 symptoms and nine impacts had significant associations with ≥one HT. Hot flush (relative risk [RR], 6.70 [95% CI, 3.36 to 13.36]), arthralgia (RR, 6.67 [95% CI, 3.53 to 12.59]), weight increased (RR, 4.83 [95% CI, 3.20 to 7.28]), mood swings (RR, 7.36 [95% CI, 5.75 to 9.42]), insomnia (RR, 4.76 [95% CI, 3.14 to 7.22]), and depression (RR, 3.05 [95% CI, 1.71 to 5.44]) demonstrated the strongest associations. Severe headache, dizziness, back pain, and muscle spasms showed significant associations with ≥one HT despite their low overall prevalence in eBC posts.\\nCONCLUSION: The social listening approach allowed the identification of real-world insights from posts specific to eBC HT from a large-scale online breast cancer forum that captured experiences from a uniquely diverse group of patients. Using NLP has a potential to scale analysis of patient feedback and reveal actionable insights into patient experiences of treatment that can inform the development of future therapies and improve the care of patients with eBC.', '39102422': 'BACKGROUND: Understanding the risk of chikungunya virus (CHIKV) infection and rheumatic sequelae across populations, including travelers and the military, is critical. We leveraged healthcare delivery data of over 9 million U.S. Military Health System (MHS) beneficiaries to identify cases, and sampled controls, to estimate the risk of post-CHIKV rheumatic sequelae.\\nMETHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: MHS beneficiary CHIKV infections diagnosed 2014-2018 were identified from the Disease Reporting System internet, TRICARE Encounter Data Non-Institutional, and Comprehensive Ambulatory/Professional Encounter Record systems. Non-CHIKV controls were matched (1:4) by age, gender, beneficiary status, and encounter date. The frequency of comorbidities and incident rheumatic diagnoses through December 2018 were derived from International Classification of Diseases codes and compared between cases and controls. Poisson regression models estimated the association of CHIKV infection with rheumatic sequelae. We further performed a nested case-control study to estimate risk factors for post-CHIKV sequelae in those with prior CHIKV. 195 CHIKV cases were diagnosed between July 2014 and December 2018. The median age was 42 years, and 43.6% were active duty. 63/195 (32.3%) of CHIKV cases had an incident rheumatic diagnosis, including arthralgia, polyarthritis, polymyalgia rheumatica, and/or rheumatoid arthritis, compared to 156/780 (20.0%) of controls (p < 0.001). CHIKV infection remained associated with rheumatic sequelae (aRR = 1.579, p = 0.008) after adjusting for prior rheumatic disease and demography. Those with rheumatic CHIKV sequelae had a median 7 healthcare encounters (IQR 3-15). Among CHIKV infections, we found no association between post-CHIKV rheumatic sequelae and demography, service characteristics, or comorbidities.\\nCONCLUSIONS/SIGNIFICANCE: CHIKV infection is uncommon but associated with rheumatic sequelae among MHS beneficiaries, with substantial healthcare requirements in a proportion of cases with such sequelae. No demographic, clinical, or occupational variables were associated with post-CHIKV rheumatic sequelae, suggesting that prediction of these complications is challenging in MHS beneficiaries. These findings are important context for future CHIKV vaccine decision making in this and other populations.', '39101327': 'Whipple disease is a rare systemic illness associated with weight loss, diarrhea, and arthralgia. Asymptomatic carriage is common, but the disease can be complicated by cardiac involvement and may result in culture-negative endocarditis. Cardiac manifestations of the disease can lead to death. This report presents the case of a 66-year-old man with Whipple disease and biventricular heart failure with cardiogenic shock. Medical therapy followed by successful replacement of the aortic and mitral valves resulted in substantial improvement.', '39100024': \"Coxsackie B virus is primarily associated with fever, pharyngitis, and gastrointestinal symptoms, while myocarditis is rarely reported. We present a rare case of a 47-year-old male with a history of hypertension and obesity, who developed Coxsackie B virus-induced myositis, myocarditis, and polyarthralgia. The patient presented with worsening back pain radiating to his chest, migratory arthralgia, exertional dyspnea, and bilateral shoulder pain with arm weakness. Initial investigations revealed elevated creatinine kinase (CK) levels and troponin I, alongside a high white blood cell (WBC) count and C-reactive protein (CRP) levels. Given the patient's symptoms and uptrending troponin without EKG changes, there was a high concern for non-ST-elevation myocardial infarction (NSTEMI), leading to initial treatment with aspirin and IV heparin. However, further questioning revealed a recent sore throat and contact with an ill family member, prompting investigations for an infectious etiology. A viral panel confirmed Coxsackie B virus infection.\\xa0The patient made a full recovery with supportive care. This case highlights the importance of considering viral causes, particularly the Coxsackie B virus, in patients presenting with muscle pain, cardiac symptoms, and joint pain. Comprehensive viral testing is crucial for early identification and appropriate management to prevent long-term complications. Understanding the mechanisms of Coxsackie B virus infection is essential for developing effective treatment strategies addressing both the viral infection and the inflammatory response.\", '39096936': 'This infographic accompanies the editorial which critically evaluates how hip-related pain is currently managed, highlighting the limitations of traditional biomedical interventions alone in restoring optimal function and well-being. Psychological factors are key determinants of outcomes after surgical and nonsurgical treatment. We highlight the need for a holistic, patient-centered approach in evaluating and treating hip-related pain. Shifting to a holistic, patient-centered approach can improve treatment outcomes and reduce patient suffering. We guide readers to the impact of psychological factors on treatment outcomes, provide clinical considerations for how clinicians might approach psychologically informed practice, and outline future research directions.

DESIGN: This observational longitudinal study included 142 patients who were undergoing rotator cuff repair. All measures took place pre-rotator cuff repair (T0), and 12 weeks (T1) and 12 months (T2) after rotator cuff repair. METHODS: Mixed-effects linear regression modeled relationships between the Western Ontario Rotator Cuff Index (WORC, model A), the Subjective Shoulder Value (SSV, model B), and EuroQol's EQ-5D-5L for QoL (model C), and potential prognostic factors over time. Factors included psychosocial variables, sleep-related indices, and proxies of central pain processing. Patients' age, sex, and body mass index complemented the analyses. RESULTS: At follow-up (T2), data from 124 participants were available for analysis. Five prognostic factors were identified for the 1-year outcome. Better expectations for symptom reduction (P&lt;.0001, -1.4 mm) and an increase in Douleur Neuropathique 4 score (P = .0481, -0.9 mm) affected the evolution of WORC over time (model A). An increase in injury perception subscale consequence (P = .0035, 0.04%) influenced the SSV trajectory (model B). In addition, when sleep quality (P = .0011, -0.13%) and sleep efficiency (P = .0002, 0.005%) improved, the EQ-5D-5L slope was affected (model C). CONCLUSION: Addressing cognitions, pain mechanisms and sleep behavior prior to rotator cuff repair can identify people who are at risk of a poor outcome after surgery.

Such syndrome gave rise to a clinical picture similar to that of either a connective tissue disease or an autoimmune disease.\\nPATIENT CONCERNS: A Chinese young female initially presenting with arthralgia, Raynaud phenomenon, generalized edema, and a positive anti-small nuclear ribonucleoprotein particle antibody was diagnosed as mixed connective tissue disease. The kidney biopsy showed thrombotic microangiopathy. Bone marrow smear showed bone marrow hyperplasia and biopsy revealed suspected light chain restricted expression, megakaryocyte proliferation, and moderate to severe bone marrow fibrosis. A lymph node biopsy was conducted and the histopathological findings were consistent with the subtype of mixed Castleman disease. The clinical symptoms were relieved after regular chemotherapy.\\nDIAGNOSES: After above examination results and clinical manifestations, the final diagnoses was TAFRO syndrome.\\nINTERVENTION: The she was started on chemotherapy with bortezomib, cyclophosphamide, and dexamethasone.\\nOUTCOME: After chemotherapy, symptoms such as thrombocytopenia, hematuria and proteinuria disappeared, lymphadenopathy and VEGF level decreased, and bone marrow fibrosis relieved.\\nLESSONS: Our case illustrated the first cases of shared characteristics of mixed connective tissue disease and iMCD-TAFRO syndrome. Cytokines may play a role in the shared pathogenicity of the iMCD-TAFRO syndrome and systemic autoimmune diseases. Therapy directly against inflammatory factors such as corticosteroids or chemotherapy have an important therapeutic implication.', '39086571': \"No meta-analysis has holistically analysed and summarized the efficacy and safety of osilodrostat, a novel dual 11β-hydroxylase (cytochrome P450 family 11 subfamily B member 1 [CYP11B1]) and 18-hydroxylase (aldosterone synthase, CYP11B2) inhibitor in managing Cushing's syndrome (CS). We undertook this meta-analysis to address this knowledge gap. Electronic databases were searched for randomized controlled trials (RCTs) involving patients with CS receiving osilodrostat in the intervention arm. The primary outcome was to evaluate changes in urine free cortisol (UFC) levels. Secondary outcomes were to evaluate alterations in cortisol levels, androgen levels, mineralocorticoid levels, and adverse events. From initially screened 109 articles, data from 2 RCTs involving 144 patients was analysed. After 8-12 weeks of therapy, the odds of achieving a normal 24-hour UFC was higher in patients receiving oslidrostat as compared to placebo. [odds ratio (OR) 21.94 (95% CI: 8.53-56.43); P &lt; 0.00001; I2 = 0%].

The occurrence of nausea [OR 4.25 (95% CI: 1.26-14.30); P = 0.02; I2 = 0%; LH] and arthralgia [OR 6.54 (95% CI: 1.64-26.13); P = 0.008; I2 = 0%; LH; HCE] was significantly higher in the osilodrostat group as compared to placebo.

      "METHODS: Major databases were searched from inception to May 2023 for studies on BUS diagnostic accuracy in IBD.

Endoscopic evaluation was performed between days 3 and 180. The pooled diagnostic accuracy of BUS in IBD was 66% (95% confidence interval [CI] 58-72%; I2=78%), sensitivity was 88.6% (95%CI 85-91%; I2=77%), and specificity 86% (95%CI 81-90%; I2=95%). PPV and NPV were 94% (95%CI 93-96%; I2=25%) and 74% (95%CI 66-80%; I2=95%), respectively. On subgroup analysis, small-intestine contrast-enhanced ultrasonography (SICUS) demonstrated high sensitivity (97%, 95%CI 91-99%; I2=83%), whereas BUS exhibited high specificity (94%, 95%CI 92-96%; I2=0%) and NPV (76%, 95%CI 68-83%; I2=80.9%).

      "METHODS: An emergency department (ED) cohort (February to August 2021) and a mixed intensive care unit (ICU) cohort (August 2017 to February 2018) were identified and analyzed separately.

Low-eGFR (<30 ml/min) subanalysis yielded AUC, sensitivity, specificity, PPV, NPV, and LR+ of 0.83, 86%, 60%, 15%, 98%, and 2.2, respectively, in the ED cohort.

      "METHODS: Major databases were searched from inception to May 2023 for studies on BUS diagnostic accuracy in IBD.

      "RESULTS: Twenty studies (1094 patients) were included in the final analysis. The majority (75%) of studies considered bowel wall thickness &gt;3 mm as abnormal. Endoscopic evaluation was performed between days 3 and 180. The pooled diagnostic accuracy of BUS in IBD was 66% (95% confidence interval [CI] 58-72%; I2=78%), sensitivity was 88.6% (95%CI 85-91%; I2=77%), and specificity 86% (95%CI 81-90%; I2=95%). PPV and NPV were 94% (95%CI 93-96%; I2=25%) and 74% (95%CI 66-80%; I2=95%), respectively. On subgroup analysis, small-intestine contrast-enhanced ultrasonography (SICUS) demonstrated high sensitivity (97%, 95%CI 91-99%; I2=83%), whereas BUS exhibited high specificity (94%, 95%CI 92-96%; I2=0%) and NPV (76%, 95%CI 68-83%; I2=80.9%).
