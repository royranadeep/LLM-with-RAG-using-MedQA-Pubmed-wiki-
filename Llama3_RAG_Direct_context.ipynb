       "'Comparison of clinical outcomes between aggressive and nonaggressive intravenous hydration for acute pancreatitis a systematic review and metaanalysis Current practice guidelines for optimal infusion rates during early intravenous hydration in patients with acute pancreatitis AP remain inconsistent This systematic review and metaanalysis aimed to compare treatment outcomes between aggressive and nonaggressive intravenous hydration in severe and nonsevere AP This study followed the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and MetaAnalyses guidelines We systematically searched PubMed Embase and Cochrane Library for randomized controlled trials RCTs on November 23 2022 and handsearched the reference lists of included RCTs relevant review articles and clinical guidelines We included RCTs that compared clinical outcomes from aggressive and nonaggressive intravenous hydration in AP Metaanalysis was performed using a randomeffects model for participants with severe AP and nonsevere AP Our primary outcome was allcause mortality and several secondary outcomes included fluidrelated complications clinical improvement and APACHE II scores within 48 h We included a total of 9 RCTs with 953 participants The metaanalysis indicated that compared to nonaggressive intravenous hydration aggressive intravenous hydration significantly increased mortality risk in severe AP pooled RR 245 95 CI 137 440 while the result in nonsevere AP was inconclusive pooled RR 226 95 CI 054 944 However aggressive intravenous hydration significantly increased fluidrelated complication risk in both severe pooled RR 222 95 CI 136 363 and nonsevere AP pooled RR 325 95 CI 153 693 The metaanalysis indicated worse APACHE II scores pooled mean difference 331 95 CI 179 484 in severe AP and no increased likelihood of clinical improvement pooled RR120 95 CI 063 229 in nonsevere AP Sensitivity analyses including only RCTs with goaldirected fluid therapy after initial fluid resuscitation therapy yielded consistent results Aggressive intravenous hydration increased the mortality risk in severe AP and fluidrelated complication risk in both severe and nonsevere AP More conservative intravenous fluid resuscitation protocols for AP are suggested The online version contains supplementary material available at 101186s13054023044010 Acute pancreatitis AP is one of the most frequent and critical gastrointestinal diseases resulting in hospital admissions worldwide The global incidence and mortality of acute pancreatitis is estimated at 34 cases per 100000 personyears and 16 deaths per 100000 personyears respectively and the incidence has been reported to be rising in recent years Appropriate initial management decisions for AP can significantly affect the disease course and hospitalization duration According to a number of international guidelines early fluid resuscitation with predominantly isotonic crystalloid ie normal saline or Ringers lactate solution is widely indicated for AP management to prevent hypovolemia and organ hypoperfusion without waiting for hemodynamic worsening However the guidelines for the design of fluid resuscitation protocols remain inconsistent when it comes to the infusion rate For example the American College of Gastroenterology ACG guidelines suggest that aggressive intravenous hydration 250500 mlhour should be given to all patients with AP in the first 1224 h unless cardiovascular andor renal comorbidities exist For severe AP the Italian Association for the Study of the Pancreas AISP suggests early aggressive hydration at 2 mlkgh with an initial bolus of 20 mlkg within 3045 min in the first 24 h However the guidelines of the American Gastroenterological Association AGA and experts from ACGs Acute Pancreatitis Task Force suggest a goaldirected fluid therapy but are unable to make specific recommendations on the optimal initial rate of fluid resuscitation in AP due to the paucity of evidence Three previous systematic review and metaanalysis studies potentially with methodological flaws yielded inconsistent findings on the effects of aggressive intravenous hydration in AP Gad MM et al concluded that aggressive intravenous fluid therapy did not reduce mortality in AP based on 9 included studies 3 randomized controlled trials RCTs and 6 cohort studies and Liao J et al concluded that aggressive hydration increases inhospital mortality in AP by 166 times based on 12 included studies 4 RCTs and 8 cohort studies However the certainty of evidence CoE from these reviews was compromised since the inclusion of observational studies with RCTs in metaanalyses frequently increases heterogeneity among the included studies and is therefore discouraged Another systematic review and metaanalysis from Di Martino M et al reported that highrate fluid infusion increased mortality about threefold in AP compared to moderaterate fluid infusion based on 4 RCTs However these previous metaanalyses did not separately analyze the severity of AP so firm conclusions regarding specific AP populations cannot be drawn Recently interim findings from the WATERFALL trial indicated about threefold increased risks of fluid overload and potentially threefold increased risks of mortality in patients with nonsevere AP receiving aggressive intravenous fluid resuscitation compared to those receiving nonaggressive fluid resuscitation Since the heterogeneity in terms of disease severity of the population studied in previous RCTs has probably contributed to inconsistent findings we conducted this systematic review and metaanalysis of RCTs separately reporting and contrasting the benefits and harms of aggressive and nonaggressive intravenous hydration protocols for severe and nonsevere AP This systematic review and metaanalysis followed the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and MetaAnalyses PRISMA guidelines Additional file 1 Appendix Table S1 and the predefined study protocol has been published on the International Platform of Registered Systematic Review and Metaanalysis Protocols INPLASY with the registration number INPLASY2022110068 We searched

emergency potentially fatal This rare side effect is most commonly associated with firstgeneration antipsychotics and less frequently with atypical or secondgeneration antipsychotics The diagnosis relies on both clinical and laboratory criteria with other organic and psychiatric conditions being ruled out A 39yearold female patient who is institutionalized and completely dependent has a medical history of recurrent urinary infections and colonization by carbapenemresistant Klebsiella pneumoniae Her regular medication regimen included sertraline valproic acid quetiapine risperidone lorazepam diazepam haloperidol baclofen and fentanyl The patient began experiencing dyspnea Upon physical examination she exhibited hypotension and a diminished vesicular murmur at the right base during pulmonary auscultation Initially after hospitalization she developed high febrile peaks associated with hemodynamic instability prompting the initiation of antibiotic treatment Despite this her fever persisted without an increase in blood inflammatory parameters and she developed purulent sputum necessitating antibiotherapy escalation The seventh day of hospitalization showed no improvement in symptoms suggesting NNMS as a differential diagnosis All antipsychotic and sedative drugs as well as antibiotherapy were discontinued after which the patient showed significant clinical improvement Antipsychotic agents are commonly employed to manage behavioral changes linked to various disorders However their severe side effects necessitate a high degree of vigilance the cessation of all medications and the implementation of supportive care measures A prompt and accurate diagnosis of NMS is crucial to alleviating the severe prolonged morbidity and potential mortality associated with

highest incidence of NMS eg haloperidol Though secondgeneration antipsychotics SGAs have a lower incidence lowpotency FGAs have not been imputed alone in any case of NMS Additional risk factors identified include preexisting organic pathologies of the central nervous system lithium treatment infections and the cessation of medication with anticholinergic properties or alcohol Given the rising use of SGAs it is crucial to remain cognizant of the associated risk of NMS The diagnostic criteria for NMS encompass altered mental status heightened muscle stiffness fever autonomic dysfunction and analytical alterations such as elevated creatine phosphokinase CPK However the presentation of NMS can vary with some patients developing the syndrome without rigidity Consequently there is no specific test available for NMS and diagnosis relies heavily on clinical suspicion NMS complications can lead to multiple organ system failure aspiration pneumonia pulmonary embolism disseminated intravascular coagulation and persistent cognitive sequelae These longterm cognitive effects are often the result of hypoxia and prolonged hyperthermia While it is not always possible to scientifically validate treatment recommendations the significance of prompt supportive care is universally accepted Additionally discontinuing the use of causative antipsychotics is crucial to reducing mortality rates Significantly reducing the morbidity and mortality of this perilous condition can be achieved through the minimization of risk factors early identification and swift management A multidisciplinary approach could potentially be the key to a successful outcome Further research is urgently required to scientifically substantiate the pathophysiology of NMS and

indicated for treatment of schizophrenia and bipolar disorder This new antipsychotic has low rate of extrapyramidal side effects metabolic changes and no significant adverse effect on serum prolactin concentration In additionit is not associated with significant weight gain like other atypical antipsychotics As a reason when other antipsychotics cause these adverse events its not uncommon to switch to Aripiprazole Obsessive compulsive symptoms have been untoward sequel of a few secondgeneration antipsychotics Among the second generation antipsychotics Clozapine Olanzapine and Risperidone are the most prominent agents associated with these sequelae according to case reports More recently a handful of case reports indicated development of Obsessivecompulsive symptoms with Aripiprazole We report a case that exhibited similar unexpected adverse effects after administration of Aripiprazole Keywords Aripiprazole Second generation antipsychotics Obsessivecompulsive symptoms OCS Aripiprazole is a D2 dopamine receptor partial agonist a major differentiating pharmacologic feature compared to serotonin dopamine antagonists Due to its D2 partial agonist actions aripiprazole is theoretically an atypical antipsychotic with reduced extrapyramidal side effects EPS and hyperprolactinemia It has a partial agonistic activity on serotonin 5HT1A receptors and an antagonistic activity on 5HT2A receptors Aripiprazole is effective in treating schizophrenia and mania It lacks the pharmacological properties normally associated with sedation namely M1muscarinic cholinergic and H1histaminic antagonist properties and thus is not generally sedating A major differentiating feature of aripiprazole is that it has little or no propensity for weight gain Furthermore there seems to be little association of aripiprazole with dyslipidemia elevation of fasting triglycerides or insulin resistance In fact when patients with weight gain and dyslipidemia caused by other antipsychotics are switched to aripiprazole there can be weight loss and lowering of fasting triglyceride levels The pharmacologic properties that make aripiprazole different in terms of its lower metabolic risk are unknown but could be explained if aripiprazole lacks the ability to bind to postulated receptors that mediate insulin resistance and hypertriglyceridemia To avoid relapse in patients with psychosis it is important to continue antipsychotic treatment following stabilization of the patient after an acute episode However sometimes relatively stable patients receiving maintenance therapy with another antipsychotic may need to switch to aripiprazole because of adverse effects These may include EPS weight gain hyperglycemia hyperlipidemia cardiovascular conditions and increased serum prolactin Considered as having a favorable metabolic profile aripiprazole could be viewed as an important factor for use in longterm treatment In addition the lack of sedative effects at clinically effective doses may help to motivate patients to continue maintenance therapy with aripiprazole Emergence or exacerbation of obsessivecompulsive symptoms OCS during treatment with atypical antipsychotics has been extensively described in the literature It was noticed that a few antipsychotics can cause obsessivecompulsive like symptoms Clozapine olanzapine and risperidone are the most prominent agents associated with OC symptoms However there are only a few case reports of the appearance of OCS due to aripiprazole We report a case that exhibited OCS after administration of aripiprazole for treatment of a psychotic disorder A written informed consent was taken from the patient A 35yearold female who was a known case of unspecified nonorganic psychosis maintaining on risperidone 1 mg reported for a regular followup She was on risperidone for the past 6 years following postpartum psychosis She also had a few relapses over the past years Risperidone was gradually tapered over the years During her followups she persistently complained of weight gain Clinical examination and routine investigations were done to rule out other causes of weight gain and then risperidone was stopped and she was started on tablet aripiprazole 5 mg Following this 3 weeks later she reported to the outpatient department with complaints of having distressing thoughts and impulses to hit and kill her children She also mentioned that she has been throwing rods sticks and sickle out of her home as she was worried that she might harm her children These thoughts and impulses were persistent and intrusive She considered them as irrational inappropriate and they caused a lot of distress in her She also claimed that they were her own thoughts and could not ignore or suppress them though she tried No other obsessivecompulsive symptoms were noticed or reported She had no past history of similar symptoms and no family history of psychiatric disorders She had no significant medical history On mental status examination she was found to have no active psychotic symptoms The patient was evaluated with routine investigations and magnetic resonance imaging of the brain which were within normal limits Aripiprazole was stopped and escitalopram 10 mg was started to treat the obsessive symptoms Risperidone was started again in view of her previous response and increased to 2 mg Over 2 weeks the patient reported of significant improvement Over 6 weeks escitalopram was gradually tapered and stopped and she was continued only on risperidone When she reported for followup after 4 weeks she had no obsessivecompulsive or psychotic symptoms She was advised dietary and lifestyle modifications and regular exercises for the management of her weight This case reports a rare instance in which administration of a partial dopamine agonist aripiprazole during treatment of psychosis induced obsessivecompulsive thoughts and impulses These symptoms were not related to psychosis as she did not have similar symptoms in the past and there was no new emergence of psychotic symptoms Moreover features were suggestive of obsessive symptoms Furthermore the time relationship between aripiprazole administration and the development of obsessive thoughts and impulses supports its causative role In addition routine investigations and neuroimaging were done to rule out organic causes for the newly emerged symptoms and all were found to be within normal limits Therefore obsessive thoughts and impulses in the present case are not considered as part of psychosis or result of any organic disorder Previous case reports indicate that most secondgeneration antipsychotics SGAs have been implicated in the de novo emergence and exacerbation of OCS in patients with schizophrenia despite having antiobsessional effects Among.'"

infusion rates during early intravenous hydration in patients with acute pancreatitis AP remain inconsistent This systematic review and metaanalysis aimed to compare treatment outcomes between aggressive and nonaggressive intravenous hydration in severe and nonsevere AP This study followed the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and MetaAnalyses guidelines We systematically searched PubMed Embase and Cochrane Library for randomized controlled trials RCTs on November 23 2022 and handsearched the reference lists of included RCTs relevant review articles and clinical guidelines We included RCTs that compared clinical outcomes from aggressive and nonaggressive intravenous hydration in AP Metaanalysis was performed using a randomeffects model for participants with severe AP and nonsevere AP Our primary outcome was allcause mortality and several secondary outcomes included fluidrelated complications clinical improvement and APACHE II scores within 48 h We included a total of 9 RCTs with 953 participants The metaanalysis indicated that compared to nonaggressive intravenous hydration aggressive intravenous hydration significantly increased mortality risk in severe AP pooled RR 245 95 CI 137 440 while the result in nonsevere AP was inconclusive pooled RR 226 95 CI 054 944 However aggressive intravenous hydration significantly increased fluidrelated

resuscitation therapy yielded consistent results Aggressive intravenous hydration increased the mortality risk in severe AP and fluidrelated complication risk in both severe and nonsevere AP More conservative intravenous fluid resuscitation protocols for AP are suggested The online version contains supplementary material available at 101186s13054023044010 Acute pancreatitis AP is one of the most frequent and critical gastrointestinal diseases resulting in hospital admissions worldwide The global incidence and mortality of acute pancreatitis is estimated at 34 cases per 100000 personyears and 16 deaths per 100000 personyears respectively and the incidence has been reported to be rising in recent years Appropriate initial management decisions for AP can significantly affect the disease course and hospitalization duration According to a number of international guidelines early fluid resuscitation with predominantly isotonic crystalloid ie normal saline or Ringers lactate solution is widely indicated for AP management to prevent hypovolemia and organ hypoperfusion without waiting for hemodynamic worsening However the guidelines for the design of fluid resuscitation protocols remain inconsistent when it comes to the infusion rate For example the American College of Gastroenterology ACG guidelines suggest that aggressive intravenous hydration 250500 mlhour should be given to all patients with AP in the first 1224 h unless cardiovascular andor renal comorbidities exist For severe AP the Italian Association for the Study of the Pancreas AISP suggests early aggressive hydration at 2 mlkgh with an initial bolus of 20 mlkg within 3045 min in the first 24 h However the guidelines of the American Gastroenterological Association AGA and experts from ACGs Acute Pancreatitis Task Force suggest a goaldirected fluid therapy but are unable to make specific recommendations on the optimal initial rate of fluid resuscitation in AP due to the paucity of evidence Three previous systematic review and metaanalysis studies potentially with methodological flaws yielded inconsistent findings on the effects of aggressive intravenous hydration in AP Gad MM et al concluded that aggressive intravenous fluid therapy did not reduce mortality in AP based on 9 included studies 3 randomized controlled trials RCTs and 6 cohort studies and Liao J et al concluded that aggressive hydration increases inhospital mortality in AP by 166 times based on 12 included studies 4 RCTs and 8 cohort studies However the certainty of evidence CoE from these reviews was compromised since the inclusion of observational studies with RCTs in metaanalyses frequently increases heterogeneity among the included studies and is therefore discouraged Another systematic review and metaanalysis from Di Martino M et al reported that highrate fluid infusion increased mortality about threefold in AP compared to moderaterate fluid infusion based on 4 RCTs However these previous metaanalyses did not separately analyze the severity of AP so firm conclusions regarding specific AP populations cannot be drawn Recently interim findings from the WATERFALL trial indicated about threefold increased risks of fluid overload and potentially threefold increased risks of mortality in patients with nonsevere AP receiving aggressive intravenous fluid resuscitation compared to those receiving nonaggressive fluid resuscitation Since the heterogeneity in terms of disease severity of the population studied in previous RCTs has probably contributed to inconsistent findings we

administration of Aripiprazole Keywords Aripiprazole Second generation antipsychotics Obsessivecompulsive symptoms OCS Aripiprazole is a D2 dopamine receptor partial agonist a major differentiating pharmacologic feature compared to serotonin dopamine antagonists Due to its D2 partial agonist actions aripiprazole is theoretically an atypical antipsychotic with reduced extrapyramidal side effects EPS and hyperprolactinemia It has a partial agonistic activity on serotonin 5HT1A receptors and an antagonistic activity on 5HT2A receptors Aripiprazole is effective in treating schizophrenia and mania It lacks the pharmacological properties normally associated with sedation namely M1muscarinic cholinergic and H1histaminic antagonist properties and thus is not generally sedating A major differentiating feature of aripiprazole is that it has little or no propensity for weight gain Furthermore there seems to be little association of aripiprazole with dyslipidemia elevation of fasting triglycerides or insulin resistance In fact when patients with weight gain and dyslipidemia caused by other antipsychotics are switched to aripiprazole there can be weight loss and lowering of fasting triglyceride levels The pharmacologic properties that make aripiprazole different in terms of its lower metabolic risk are unknown but could be explained if aripiprazole lacks the ability to bind to postulated receptors that mediate insulin resistance and hypertriglyceridemia To avoid relapse in patients with psychosis it is important to continue antipsychotic treatment following stabilization of the patient after an acute episode However sometimes relatively stable patients receiving maintenance therapy with another antipsychotic may need to switch to aripiprazole because of adverse effects These may include EPS weight gain hyperglycemia hyperlipidemia cardiovascular conditions and increased serum prolactin Considered as having a favorable metabolic profile aripiprazole could be viewed as an important factor for use in longterm treatment In addition the lack of sedative effects at clinically effective doses may help to motivate patients to continue maintenance therapy with aripiprazole Emergence or exacerbation of obsessivecompulsive symptoms OCS during treatment with atypical antipsychotics has been extensively described in the literature It was noticed that a few antipsychotics can cause obsessivecompulsive like symptoms Clozapine olanzapine and risperidone are the most prominent agents associated with OC symptoms However there are only a few case reports of

following postpartum psychosis She also had a few relapses over the past years Risperidone was gradually tapered over the years During her followups she persistently complained of weight gain Clinical examination and routine investigations were done to rule out other causes of weight gain and then risperidone was stopped and she was started on tablet aripiprazole 5 mg Following this 3 weeks later she reported to the outpatient department with complaints of having distressing thoughts and impulses to hit and kill her children She also mentioned that she has been throwing rods sticks and sickle

distress in her She also claimed that they were her own thoughts and could not ignore or suppress them though she tried No other obsessivecompulsive symptoms were noticed or reported She had no past history of similar symptoms and no family history of psychiatric disorders She had no significant medical history On mental status examination she was found to have no active psychotic symptoms The patient was evaluated with routine investigations and magnetic resonance imaging of the brain which were within normal limits Aripiprazole was stopped and escitalopram 10 mg was started to treat the obsessive symptoms Risperidone was started again in view of her previous response and increased to 2 mg Over 2 weeks the patient reported of significant improvement Over 6 weeks escitalopram was gradually tapered and stopped and she was continued only on risperidone When she reported for followup after 4 weeks she had no obsessivecompulsive or psychotic symptoms She was advised dietary and

      " Comparison of clinical outcomes between aggressive and nonaggressive intravenous hydration for acute pancreatitis a systematic review and metaanalysis Current practice guidelines for optimal infusion rates during early intravenous hydration in patients with acute pancreatitis AP remain inconsistent This systematic review and metaanalysis aimed to compare treatment outcomes between aggressive and nonaggressive intravenous hydration in severe and nonsevere AP This study followed the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and MetaAnalyses guidelines We systematically searched PubMed Embase and Cochrane Library for randomized controlled trials RCTs on November 23 2022 and handsearched the reference lists of included RCTs relevant review articles and clinical guidelines We included RCTs that compared clinical outcomes from aggressive and nonaggressive intravenous hydration in AP Metaanalysis was performed using a randomeffects model for participants with severe AP and nonsevere AP Our primary outcome was allcause mortality and several secondary outcomes included fluidrelated complications clinical improvement and APACHE II scores within 48 h We included a total of 9 RCTs with 953 participants The metaanalysis indicated that compared to nonaggressive intravenous hydration aggressive intravenous hydration significantly increased mortality risk in severe AP pooled RR 245 95 CI 137 440 while the result in nonsevere AP was inconclusive pooled RR 226 95 CI 054 944 However aggressive intravenous hydration significantly increased fluidrelated complication risk in both severe pooled RR 222 95 CI 136 363 and nonsevere AP pooled RR 325 95 CI 153 693 The metaanalysis indicated worse APACHE II scores pooled mean difference 331 95 CI 179 484 in severe AP and no increased likelihood of clinical improvement pooled RR120 95 CI 063 229 in nonsevere AP Sensitivity analyses including only RCTs with goaldirected fluid therapy after initial fluid resuscitation therapy yielded consistent results Aggressive intravenous hydration increased the mortality risk in severe AP and fluidrelated complication risk in both severe and nonsevere AP More conservative intravenous fluid resuscitation protocols for AP are suggested The online version contains supplementary material available at 101186s13054023044010 Acute pancreatitis AP is one of the most frequent and critical gastrointestinal diseases resulting in hospital admissions worldwide The global incidence and mortality of acute pancreatitis is estimated at 34 cases per 100000 personyears and 16 deaths per 100000 personyears respectively and the incidence has been reported to be rising in recent years Appropriate initial management decisions for AP can significantly affect the disease course and hospitalization duration According to a number of international guidelines early fluid resuscitation with predominantly isotonic crystalloid ie normal saline or Ringers lactate solution is widely indicated for AP management to prevent hypovolemia and organ hypoperfusion without waiting for hemodynamic worsening However the guidelines for the design of fluid resuscitation protocols remain inconsistent when it comes to the infusion rate For example the American College of Gastroenterology ACG guidelines suggest that aggressive intravenous hydration 250500 mlhour should be given to all patients with AP in the first 1224 h unless cardiovascular andor renal comorbidities exist For severe AP the Italian Association for the Study of the Pancreas AISP suggests early aggressive hydration at 2 mlkgh with an initial bolus of 20 mlkg within 3045 min in the first 24 h However the guidelines of the American Gastroenterological Association AGA and experts from ACGs Acute Pancreatitis Task Force suggest a goaldirected fluid therapy but are unable to make specific recommendations on the optimal initial rate of fluid resuscitation in AP due to the paucity of evidence Three previous systematic review and metaanalysis studies potentially with methodological flaws yielded inconsistent findings on the effects of aggressive intravenous hydration in AP Gad MM et al concluded that aggressive intravenous fluid therapy did not reduce mortality in AP based on 9 included studies 3 randomized controlled trials RCTs and 6 cohort studies and Liao J et al concluded that aggressive hydration increases inhospital mortality in AP by 166 times based on 12 included studies 4 RCTs and 8 cohort studies However the certainty of evidence CoE from these reviews was compromised since the inclusion of observational studies with RCTs in metaanalyses frequently increases heterogeneity among the included studies and is therefore discouraged Another systematic review and metaanalysis from Di Martino M et al reported that highrate fluid infusion increased mortality about threefold in AP compared to moderaterate fluid infusion based on 4 RCTs However these previous metaanalyses did not separately analyze the severity of AP so firm conclusions regarding specific AP populations cannot be drawn Recently interim findings from the WATERFALL trial indicated about threefold increased risks of fluid overload and potentially threefold increased risks of mortality in patients with nonsevere AP receiving aggressive intravenous fluid resuscitation compared to those receiving nonaggressive fluid resuscitation Since the heterogeneity in terms of disease severity of the population studied in previous RCTs has probably contributed to inconsistent findings we conducted this systematic review and metaanalysis of RCTs separately reporting and contrasting the benefits and harms of aggressive and nonaggressive intravenous hydration protocols for severe and nonsevere AP This systematic review and metaanalysis followed the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and MetaAnalyses PRISMA guidelines Additional file 1 Appendix Table S1 and the

dyspnea Upon physical examination she exhibited hypotension and a diminished vesicular murmur at the right base during pulmonary auscultation Initially after hospitalization she developed high febrile peaks associated with hemodynamic instability prompting the initiation of antibiotic treatment Despite this her fever persisted without an increase in blood inflammatory parameters and she developed purulent sputum necessitating antibiotherapy escalation The seventh day of hospitalization showed no improvement in symptoms suggesting NNMS as a differential diagnosis All antipsychotic and sedative drugs as well as antibiotherapy were discontinued after which the patient showed significant clinical improvement Antipsychotic agents are commonly employed to manage behavioral changes linked to various disorders However their severe side effects necessitate a high degree of vigilance the cessation of all medications and the implementation of supportive care measures A prompt and accurate

have a lower incidence lowpotency FGAs have not been imputed alone in any case of NMS Additional risk factors identified include preexisting organic pathologies of the central nervous system lithium treatment infections and the cessation of medication with anticholinergic properties or alcohol Given the rising use of SGAs it is crucial to remain cognizant of the associated risk of NMS The diagnostic criteria for NMS encompass altered mental status heightened muscle stiffness fever autonomic dysfunction and analytical alterations such as elevated creatine phosphokinase CPK However the presentation of NMS can vary with some patients developing the syndrome without rigidity Consequently there is no specific test available for NMS and diagnosis relies heavily on clinical suspicion NMS complications can lead to multiple organ system failure aspiration pneumonia pulmonary embolism disseminated intravascular coagulation and persistent cognitive sequelae These longterm cognitive effects are often the result of hypoxia and prolonged hyperthermia While it is not always possible to scientifically validate treatment recommendations the significance of prompt supportive care is universally accepted Additionally discontinuing the use of causative antipsychotics is crucial to reducing mortality rates Significantly reducing the morbidity and mortality of this perilous condition can be achieved through the minimization of risk factors early identification and swift management A multidisciplinary approach could potentially be the key to a successful outcome Further research is
