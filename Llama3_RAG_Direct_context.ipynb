       "'AmpicillinEster Bonded Branched Polymers Characterization Cyto Genotoxicity and Controlled DrugRelease Behaviour The development and characterization of novel macromolecular conjugates of ampicillin using branched biodegradable polymers has been described in this study The conjugates have been prepared coupling the βlactam antibiotic with branched polymer matrices based on the natural oligopeptide core The cyto and genotoxicity of the synthesized polymers were evaluated with a bacterial luminescence test two protozoan assays and Salmonella typhimurium TA1535 The presence of a newly formed covalent bond between the drug and the polymer matrices was confirmed by 1HNMR and FTIR studies A drug content 156 and 102 mole in the macromolecular conjugates has been determined The obtained macromolecular products have been subjected to further in vitro release studies The total percentage of ampicillin released after 21 days of incubation was nearly 60 and 14 and this resulted from the different physicochemical properties of the polymeric matrices This is the first report on the application of branched biodegradable polymeric matrices for the covalent conjugation of ampicillin The obtained results showed that the synthesized macromolecular drugconjugates might slowly release the active drug molecule and improve the pharmacokinetics of ampicillin βLactam antibiotics constitute a broad class of antimicrobial agents applied for systemic therapy and gastric or intestinal infections The presence of the βlactam ring in their structure is responsible for their antimicrobial activity Ampicillin 2S5R6R62R2amino2phenylacetylamino33dimethyl7oxo4thia1azabicyclo320heptane2carboxylic acid is a semisynthetic penicillin belonging to the βlactam antibiotic family which has found widespread use due to its broad spectrum of activity Ampicillin is absorbed only partially after oral administration and ordinarily about 50 of active compound is extracted in urine Ampicillin therapy is often accompanied by some gastrointestinal complications such as diarrhoea vomiting and nausea because of the low solubility of the drug in lipid membranes Furthermore ampicillin like other βlactams crosses the cell membrane very slowly and its unable to reach therapeutic concentrations at the site of infection Drugs administrated systemically are absorbed into the blood stream and distributed throughout the host patient via the circulatory system which can result in bacterial resistance When administrated locally they limit the adverse effects of systemic administration and a higher concentration of drug is reaching the target site Therefore there is a growing need to provide adequate drug concentrations at the site of action and a means of maintaining that level for a long enough period to allow the agent to act The first usage of biomaterials in medicine has provided some important complications infections and deficient tissueintegration in humans Implantassociated infections account for nearly 50 of the estimated 2million nosocomial infections in the United States per year and infection rates up to 100 are reported for certain implants like external fixation pins Treatment of these infections is associated with high complication rates and places an enormous burden on both the patient and healthcare providers prolonged hospital stay increased morbidity and mortality and serious economic consequences Hence the risk of infection might be reduced by the implementation of the polymeric implants formed by covalent conjugation of antibacterial agent to the biodegradable or bioresorbable polymers Polymerdrug conjugates are nanosized hybrid constructs that covalently combine a bioactive agent with a polymer to ensure not only its efficient delivery to the required intracellular compartment but also its availability within a specific period of time The use of polymerdrug conjugates in combination therapy is seen as an important opportunity to enhance disease response rates The macromolecular prodrugs comprise a minimum of three components as shown a natural or synthetic polymeric carrier a biodegradable polymerdrug linkage often a peptidyl or ester linkage and a bioactive agent It is assumed that the therapeutic effectiveness of a polymer prodrug is governed by the chemical or biochemical release of the drug molecule The controlled slow release of pharmacologically active agent in the body might be achieved from prodrugs which can be considered as a special type of implantable drug delivery system from which drug release is accomplished by the cleavage of chemical bond Biodegradable or bioresorbable polymers belong to a class of important and desirable biomaterials because of their wide applications in the biomedical fields including tissue engineering controlled drug delivery and gene therapy Aliphatic polyesters such as polylactide PLA and polyεcaprolactone PCL are the most commonly used due to their good biocompatibility biodegradability low immunogenicity and suitable mechanical properties Recently a few approaches using local ampicillin polymeric delivery system materials have been introduced which allows the therapeutic agent to be targeted to the disease site with minimal systemic effects Patel et al prepared the polymeric matrices of polystyrenecomaleic anhydride on which surfaces ampicillin was bound by chemical bonding in an organic medium PCL electrospun fibers containing ampicillin sodium salt have been produced and twisted into nanofibers yarns by Liu and coworkers Their results indicated that the electrospun nanofibers yarns can have a.\\nEvaluation of ceftriaxone pharmacokinetics in hospitalized Egyptian pediatric patients This study aimed to evaluate ceftriaxone pharmacokinetics that affects the achievement of targets in the treatment of critically ill children meningitis pneumonia urinary tract infection peritonitis and infective endocarditis who were admitted to Zagazig University Pediatric hospital in Egypt to monitor for the drug adverse effects Blood samples were obtained from 24 hospitalized pediatric patients ages ranging from 25 months to 12 years after administering the calculated dose of ceftriaxone via intravenous bolus route Then ceftriaxone plasma concentrations were measured using a validated HPLC method with ultraviolet detection The pharmacokinetic analysis was conducted using Phoenix Winnonlin Program software Data for total and free ceftriaxone best fitted on a onecompartment model with the firstorder elimination process Clearance of ceftriaxone is reduced for patients with reduced kidney function and increased with those with augmented renal clearance The volume of distribution and the free fraction are increased in these patients especially those with hypoalbuminemia with a shorter halflife time were detected A slight increase in total bilirubin and liver enzymes has been observed after treatment with ceftriaxone in these patients Conclusion In most critically ill pediatric patients the current ceftriaxone treatment regimen 50 to 100 mgkg offers adequate pathogenic coverage The clearance of free ceftriaxone in all patients correlates well with their renal function eGFR with r2 07252 During therapy with ceftriaxone at all doses ranging from 50 to 100 mgkg a rise in total bilirubin was observed in these patients Moreover liver enzymes ALT and AST increased moderately p 00001 So it is recommended to monitor total bilirubin and liver enzymes during the treatment with ceftriaxone especially for a long duration more than 5 days or use another agent in patients with high baseline values The online version contains supplementary material available at 101007s00431023050910 Cephalosporins are a group of antibiotics that belong to βlactams that were first isolated from the fungus Acremonium Chrysogenum They exert their antibacterial activity via inhibition of the cell wall synthesis of the bacterial cell They bind to the penicillinbinding proteins PBPs essential in synthesizing bacterial cell wall peptidoglycans As a result cell lysis occurs in the hypoosmotic or isoosmotic environment surrounding the bacterial cell Cephalosporins are classified into five generations and are effective against aerobic and anaerobic microorganisms Ceftriaxone is a thirdgeneration cephalosporin administered parenterally via intravenous or intramuscular injection Ceftriaxone is commonly used in pediatrics and has indications for bloodstream infections caused by the following microorganisms Streptococcus pneumoniae Klebsiella pneumoniae Staphylococcus aureus Hemophilus influenzae or Escherichia coli septic arthritis osteomyelitis intraabdominal infection bacterial meningitis lower respiratory tract infections pneumonia urinary tract infection including cystitis and pyelonephritis and acute otitis media Most adverse pharmacological effects associated with cephalosporin antibiotics in the pediatric population were brought on by inappropriate drug use Antibiotics can be categorized into timedependent and concentrationdependent antibiotics based on their kill characteristics Ceftriaxone has timedependent bacterial killing properties meaning that the maximum bacterial killing effect is achieved when the free plasma concentration of the drug remains above the minimum inhibitory concentration fT MIC for more than or equal to 60 to 70 of the dosing interval For most common infections ceftriaxones MIC varies from 006 to 2 mgL Also according to the European Committee on antimicrobial susceptibility testing EUCAST the optimum MIC of ceftriaxone against most susceptible organisms ranges from 05 to 2 mgL Ceftriaxone has an FDA block box warning for use in neonates less or equal to 28 days especially prematures because of the risk of development of bilirubin encephalopathy Also mixing ceftriaxone with calcium containing IV solution for example parenteral nutrition solutions is contraindicated because of the risk of precipitation of ceftriaxonecalcium complex By shedding light on ceftriaxone pharmacokinetics it has a high affinity for binding with serum albumin 8595 It has an elimination halflife t12 of 9 h up to 30 days in neonates and 4 to 66 h in infants and children which is a relatively long range Ceftriaxones free fraction not the bound fraction to plasma protein is the only portion of the entire medication responsible for the antibacterial activity and the only fraction susceptible to elimination This means that any condition such as hepatic or renal disorders causing hypoalbuminemia or hyperbilirubinemia leading to changes in the free fraction of the drug will modify the antibiotic exposure and have an impact on clinical outcomes Ceftriaxone has mixed renal elimination 3367 as an unaltered drug in urine and biliary elimination as an inactive drug in feces The pharmacokinetic parameters of ceftriaxones free fraction are linear and dosedependent meaning that when the drugs dose is increased the drugs steadystate concentration will increase accordingly Ceftriaxone dosage for children ranges from 50 to 100 mg per kg per day divided every 12 to 24 h for an average duration of five days maybe less.\\nDoxycycline prevents bloodbrain barrier dysfunction and microvascular hyperpermeability after traumatic brain injury The main objective of this study was to determine the cellular and molecular effects of doxycycline on the bloodbrain barrier BBB and protection against secondary injuries following traumatic brain injury TBI Microvascular hyperpermeability and cerebral edema resulting from BBB dysfunction after TBI leads to elevation of intracranial pressure secondary brain ischemia herniation and brain death There are currently no effective therapies to modulate the underlying pathophysiology responsible for TBIinduced BBB dysfunction and hyperpermeability The loss of BBB integrity by the proteolytic enzyme matrix metalloproteinase9 MMP9 is critical to TBIinduced BBB hyperpermeability and doxycycline possesses antiMMP9 effect In this study the effect of doxycycline on BBB hyperpermeability was studied utilizing molecular modeling using Glide in silico cell culturebased models in vitro and a mouse model of TBI in vivo Brain microvascular endothelial cell assays of tight junction protein immunofluorescence and barrier permeability were performed Adult C57BL6 mice were subjected to sham versus TBI with or without doxycycline treatment and immediate intravital microscopic analysis for evaluating BBB integrity Postmortem mouse brain tissue was collected to measure MMP9 enzyme activity It was found that doxycycline binding to the MMP9 active sites have binding affinity of 707 kcalmol Doxycycline treated cell monolayers were protected from microvascular hyperpermeability and retained tight junction integrity p 005 Doxycycline treatment decreased BBB hyperpermeability following TBI in mice by 25 p 005 MMP9 enzyme activity in brain tissue decreased with doxycycline treatment following TBI p 005 Doxycycline preserves BBB tight junction integrity following TBI via inhibiting MMP9 activity When established in human subjects doxycycline may provide readily accessible medical treatment after TBI to attenuate secondary injury Traumatic brain injury TBI is a significant and global public health concern affecting more than 57 million annually Studies show that in the United States more than5 million people live with a TBIrelated disability TBI patients with severe neurological dysfunction typically have a poor quality of life and considerable financial problems The exact expenses associated with TBI are mostly undercalculated and do not account for the years of lost income and ailment TBI can lead to devastating neurological effects and will primarily involve in the major impairment or death of a person The near future The TBI patient care is limited with one of the main difficulties being to effectively address the adverse consequences of cerebral edema that leads to an elevation of intracranial pressure ICP There are no effective therapies or approaches to alleviate the symptoms of TBI by addressing the underlying pathobiology At a cellular and molecular level TBI causes major and minor injuries This in turn leads to the formation of reactive oxygen species along with the activation of different proinflammatory cytokines and several proteolytic enzymes In TBI depending on the severity of the impact primary injury may occur as direct tissue damage from the impact resulting in irreversible tissuecellular and damage to the blood vessel at various levels This leads to a series of biological events leading to secondary injuries The damage caused due to this phenomenon might be through host cellular response or changes occurring by corresponding physiological effects During the phase of the secondary injury abnormalities in the bloodbrain barrier BBB can result in various derangements that eventually leads to a patients adverse clinical outcomes These mechanisms cause the loss of BBB integrity and normal microvascular permeability of the barrier The BBB is a semipermeable membrane with a highly complex structure consisting of interendothelial tight junctions and adherens junctions and other cellular and matrix components of the neurovascular unit for the preservation of the brain parenchyma and cerebrospinal fluid The deleterious cellular cascade of events in TBI results in microvascular hyperpermeability of the BBB This hyperpermeability leads to cerebral edema and injury and death of neurons and other cell types Identification of novel therapeutic targets and development of drugs against secondary injury by preserving the BBB integrity could be revolutionary in the care of head trauma patients Matrix metalloproteinases MMPs belongs to a family of endopeptidases that collectively cleave the constituents of the extracellular matrix MMP9 is a ubiquitous proteolytic enzyme that play a significant role in new blood vessels formation angiogenesis wound healing and embryonic development along with a litany of other cellular and physiological processes In the brain MMP9 is present at relatively low levels in normal conditions but significantly increases its expression and activity acutely following TBI Enhanced MMP9 enzymatic activity leads to damage of the BBB tight junctions by targeting the tight junction proteins resulting in barrier dysfunction and further neuroinflammation Doxycycline a tetracycline antibiotic and known for its broadspectrum coverage has been shown to inhibit MMP9 activity in traumatic processes such as in thermal injury but its potential effect on BBB breakdown and brain edema is not known Doxycycline is.\\nNitrofurantoin properties and potential in treatment of urinary tract infection a narrative review Nitrofurantoin NF a widespectrum antibiotic accessible since 1953 is utilized widely to treat urinary tract infections as it usually stays active against drugresistant uropathogen The use of Nitrofurantoin has increased exponentially since new guidelines have repositioned it as firstline therapy for uncomplicated lower urinary tract infection UTI To although fluoroquinolones are usually used to reevaluate the first and secondline therapies for treating uncomplicated UTI their level of utilization is thought to be inappropriately excessive and will eventually have a detrimental impact thus we hypothesize that NF might be the best choice for this condition because of its low frequency of utilization and its high susceptibility in common UTI pathogens It can be concluded from this review that NF can be considered as the most effective drug in the treatment of acute urinary infection but due to the longterm side effects of this drug especially in elderly patients it is essential to introduce some criteria for prescribing NF in cases of chronic UTI Nitrofurantoin NF was identified in 1953 and was first recommended for the treatment of cystitis in 2010 according to the Infectious Diseases Society of America IDSA guideline Currently 150 million Urinary Tract Infections UTIs are reported annually worldwide and drugresistant infections usually require more complex treatment regimens and are more likely to occur if treatment fails NF is outstanding because NF is most extensively utilized in humans and its effectiveness in the treatment of lower UTIs and prophylaxis is well established It is presently prescribed as firstline UTI medical care due to the emergence of resistance to different antibiotics such as carbapenem resistance It has bacteriostatic and bactericidal effects and is instantly excreted in high concentrations by the kidneys NF is bacteriostatic in low concentrations 510 pgmL and bactericidal in higher concentrations Other studies refer to the therapeutic or prophylactic use of this antibiotic In therapeutic application 50100 mg q6h regularrelease formulation or 100 mg q12h or q8h slowrelease formulation and in prophylaxis 50100 mg q24h is recommended With this background we summarized the NF data available as a valuable choice in the treatment of acute urinary infection but due to the longterm side effects of this drug especially in elderly patients it is essential to introduce some criteria for prescribing NF in cases of chronic UTI NF is a redoxactive antibacterial agent with the molecular formula of C8H6N4O5 and the molecular weight of 23816 and is an oral antibiotic based on nitrofurans NF which is a member of the nitrofuran family composed of a furan ring fivemembered aromatic ring with four carbon C atoms and one oxygen O is directly linked to a nitro group NO2 FDA Macrodantin NF Macrocrystals Capsules Product Information Cincinnati OH USA Procter Gamble Pharmaceuticals 2009 112 Figure 1 In the market NF is available in oral forms of capsules tablets and suspension oral suspension also known as furadantin NF is often prescribed in a dose of 50100 mg 4 times a day for 5 days Table 1 summarizes these characteristics of NF In terms of PK NF quickly reaches its therapeutic concentration level so 90 of NF is quickly exerted through the urine and that is why all its therapeutic effects are restricted to the treatment of UTI NF is 8090 orally bioavailable and its bioavailability is about 388443 It has a short halflife 20 minutes is active only in the urinary tract and has no other systemic activity Also it is rapidly absorbed and eliminated with low plasma protein binding to plasma proteins or tissues It is well absorbed from the gastrointestinal tract and excreted unchanged in urine 2540 and bile It has been reported that NF can accumulate in urine with its effect enhanced by the acidic pH of urine The antibacterial activity of NF and its metabolites is improved under acid conditions Metabolites are formed by bacterial enzyme reduction but the precise structure and antibacterial activity of each metabolite remains uncertain Antibiotic NF Formula C8H6N4O5 Molecular weight 23816 Bioavailability 388443 PK 90 of NF quickly exerted through the urine Pharmacodynamics Disruption of Krebs cycle and interference in metabolism of carbohydrates biosynthesis of proteins cell wall and DNA Dosage 50100 mg 4 times a day for 5 days Clinical use Urinary tract infection Adverse effects Renal pulmonary hepatic and nerve failureDrug induced fever Most absorption of NF is done in the duodenum so the presence of food in GI tract leads to an increase in the time of gastric emptying Therefore more NF dissolves in gastric juice before it reaches the duodenum The dissolution time hypothesis is supported by the results of Naggar and Khalil who showed that absorption increased when the solubility of NF was increased by the addition of Mg2O8Si3 UTI is one of the.'"

is often accompanied by some gastrointestinal complications such as diarrhoea vomiting and nausea because of the low solubility of the drug in lipid membranes Furthermore ampicillin like other βlactams crosses the cell membrane very slowly and its unable to reach therapeutic concentrations at the site of infection Drugs administrated systemically are absorbed into the blood stream and distributed throughout the host patient via the circulatory system which can result in bacterial resistance When administrated locally they limit the adverse effects of systemic administration and a higher concentration of drug is reaching the target site Therefore there is a growing need to provide adequate drug concentrations at the site of action and a means of maintaining that level for a long enough period to allow the agent to act The first usage of biomaterials in medicine has provided some important complications infections and deficient tissueintegration in humans Implantassociated infections account for nearly 50 of the estimated 2million nosocomial infections in the United States per year and infection rates up to 100 are reported for certain implants like external fixation pins Treatment of these infections is associated with high complication rates and places an enormous burden on both the patient and healthcare providers prolonged hospital stay increased morbidity and mortality and serious economic consequences Hence the risk of infection might be reduced by the implementation of the polymeric implants formed by covalent conjugation of antibacterial agent to the biodegradable or bioresorbable polymers Polymerdrug conjugates are nanosized hybrid constructs that covalently combine a bioactive agent with a polymer to ensure not only its efficient delivery to the required intracellular compartment but also its availability within a specific period of time The use of polymerdrug conjugates in combination therapy is seen as an important opportunity to enhance disease response rates The macromolecular prodrugs comprise a minimum of three components as shown a natural or synthetic polymeric carrier a biodegradable polymerdrug linkage often a peptidyl or ester linkage and a bioactive agent It is assumed that the therapeutic effectiveness of a polymer prodrug is governed by the chemical or biochemical release of the drug molecule The controlled slow release of pharmacologically active agent in the body might be achieved from prodrugs which can be considered as a special type of implantable drug delivery system from which drug release is accomplished by the cleavage of chemical bond Biodegradable or bioresorbable polymers belong to a class of important and desirable biomaterials because of their wide applications in the biomedical fields including tissue engineering controlled drug delivery and gene therapy Aliphatic polyesters such as polylactide PLA and polyεcaprolactone PCL are the most commonly used due to their good biocompatibility biodegradability low immunogenicity and suitable mechanical properties Recently a few approaches using local ampicillin polymeric delivery system materials have been introduced which allows the therapeutic agent to be targeted to the disease site with minimal systemic effects Patel et al prepared the polymeric matrices of polystyrenecomaleic anhydride on which

      "Evaluation of ceftriaxone pharmacokinetics in hospitalized Egyptian pediatric patients This study aimed to evaluate ceftriaxone pharmacokinetics that affects the achievement of targets in the treatment of critically ill children meningitis pneumonia urinary tract infection peritonitis and infective endocarditis who were admitted to Zagazig University Pediatric hospital in Egypt to monitor for the drug adverse effects Blood samples were obtained from 24 hospitalized pediatric patients ages ranging from 25 months to 12 years after administering the calculated dose of ceftriaxone via intravenous bolus route Then ceftriaxone plasma concentrations were measured using a validated HPLC method with ultraviolet detection The pharmacokinetic analysis was conducted using Phoenix Winnonlin Program software Data for total and free ceftriaxone best fitted on a onecompartment model with the firstorder elimination process Clearance of ceftriaxone is reduced for patients with reduced kidney function and increased with those with augmented renal clearance The volume of distribution and the free fraction are increased in these patients especially those with hypoalbuminemia with a shorter halflife time were detected A slight increase in total bilirubin and liver enzymes has been observed after treatment with ceftriaxone in these patients Conclusion In most critically ill pediatric patients the current ceftriaxone treatment regimen 50 to 100 mgkg offers adequate pathogenic coverage The clearance of free ceftriaxone in all patients correlates well with their renal function eGFR with r2 07252 During therapy with ceftriaxone at all doses ranging from 50 to 100 mgkg a rise in total bilirubin was observed in these patients Moreover liver enzymes ALT and AST increased moderately p 00001 So it is recommended to monitor total bilirubin and liver enzymes during the treatment with ceftriaxone especially for a long duration more than 5 days or use another agent in patients with high baseline values The online version contains supplementary material available at 101007s00431023050910 Cephalosporins are a group of antibiotics that belong to βlactams that were first isolated from the fungus Acremonium Chrysogenum They exert their antibacterial activity via inhibition of the cell wall synthesis of the bacterial cell They bind to the penicillinbinding proteins PBPs essential in synthesizing bacterial cell wall peptidoglycans As a result cell lysis occurs in the hypoosmotic or isoosmotic environment surrounding the bacterial cell Cephalosporins are classified into five generations and are effective against aerobic and anaerobic microorganisms Ceftriaxone is a thirdgeneration cephalosporin administered parenterally via intravenous or intramuscular injection Ceftriaxone is commonly used in pediatrics and has indications for bloodstream infections caused by the following microorganisms Streptococcus pneumoniae Klebsiella pneumoniae Staphylococcus aureus Hemophilus influenzae or Escherichia coli septic arthritis osteomyelitis intraabdominal infection bacterial meningitis lower respiratory tract infections pneumonia urinary tract infection including cystitis and pyelonephritis and acute otitis media Most adverse pharmacological effects associated with cephalosporin antibiotics in the pediatric population were brought on by inappropriate drug use Antibiotics can be categorized into timedependent and concentrationdependent antibiotics based on their kill characteristics Ceftriaxone has timedependent bacterial killing properties meaning that the maximum bacterial killing effect is achieved when the free plasma concentration of the drug remains above the minimum inhibitory concentration fT MIC for more than or equal to 60 to 70 of the dosing interval For most common infections ceftriaxones MIC varies from 006 to 2 mgL Also according to the European Committee on antimicrobial susceptibility testing EUCAST the optimum MIC of ceftriaxone against most susceptible organisms ranges from 05 to 2 mgL Ceftriaxone has an FDA block box warning for use in neonates less or equal to 28 days especially prematures because of the risk of development of bilirubin encephalopathy Also mixing ceftriaxone with calcium containing IV solution for example parenteral nutrition solutions is contraindicated because of the risk of precipitation of ceftriaxonecalcium complex By shedding light on ceftriaxone pharmacokinetics it has a high affinity for binding with serum albumin 8595 It has an elimination halflife t12 of 9 h up to 30 days in neonates and 4 to 66 h in infants and children which is a relatively long range Ceftriaxones free fraction not the bound fraction to plasma protein is the only portion of the entire medication responsible for the antibacterial activity and the only fraction susceptible to elimination This means that any condition such as hepatic or renal disorders causing hypoalbuminemia or hyperbilirubinemia leading to changes in the free fraction of the drug will modify the antibiotic exposure and have an impact on clinical outcomes Ceftriaxone has mixed renal elimination 3367 as an unaltered drug in urine and biliary elimination as an inactive drug in feces The pharmacokinetic parameters of ceftriaxones free fraction are linear and dosedependent meaning that when the drugs dose

adverse consequences of cerebral edema that leads to an elevation of intracranial pressure ICP There are no effective therapies or approaches to alleviate the symptoms of TBI by addressing the underlying pathobiology At a cellular and molecular level TBI causes major and minor injuries This in turn leads to the formation of reactive oxygen species along with the activation of different proinflammatory cytokines and several proteolytic enzymes In TBI depending on the severity of the impact primary injury may occur as direct tissue damage from the impact resulting in irreversible tissuecellular and damage to the blood vessel at various levels This leads to a series of biological events leading to secondary injuries The damage caused due to this phenomenon might be through host cellular response or changes occurring by corresponding physiological effects During the phase of the secondary injury abnormalities in the bloodbrain barrier BBB can result in various derangements that eventually leads to a patients adverse clinical outcomes These mechanisms cause the loss of BBB integrity and normal microvascular permeability of the barrier The BBB is a semipermeable membrane with a highly complex structure consisting of interendothelial tight junctions and adherens junctions and other cellular and matrix components of the neurovascular unit for the preservation of the brain parenchyma and cerebrospinal fluid The deleterious cellular cascade of events in TBI results in microvascular hyperpermeability of the BBB This hyperpermeability leads to cerebral edema and

      "Nitrofurantoin properties and potential in treatment of urinary tract infection a narrative review Nitrofurantoin NF a widespectrum antibiotic accessible since 1953 is utilized widely to treat urinary tract infections as it usually stays active against drugresistant uropathogen The use of Nitrofurantoin has increased exponentially since new guidelines have repositioned it as firstline therapy for uncomplicated lower urinary tract infection UTI To although fluoroquinolones are usually used to reevaluate the first and secondline therapies for treating uncomplicated UTI their level of utilization is thought to be inappropriately excessive and will eventually have a detrimental impact thus we hypothesize that NF might be the best choice for this condition because of its low frequency of utilization and its high susceptibility in common UTI pathogens It can be concluded from this review that NF can be considered as the most effective drug in the treatment of acute urinary infection but due to the longterm side effects of this drug especially in elderly patients it is essential to introduce some criteria for prescribing NF in cases of chronic UTI Nitrofurantoin NF was identified in 1953 and was first recommended for the treatment of cystitis in 2010 according to the Infectious Diseases Society of America IDSA guideline Currently 150 million Urinary Tract Infections UTIs are reported annually worldwide and drugresistant infections usually require more complex treatment regimens and are more likely to occur if treatment fails NF is outstanding because NF is most extensively utilized in humans and its effectiveness in the treatment of lower UTIs and prophylaxis is well established It is presently prescribed as firstline UTI medical care due to the emergence of resistance to different antibiotics such as carbapenem resistance It has bacteriostatic and bactericidal effects and is instantly excreted in high concentrations by the kidneys NF is bacteriostatic in low concentrations 510 pgmL and bactericidal in higher concentrations Other studies refer to the therapeutic or prophylactic use of this antibiotic In therapeutic application 50100 mg q6h regularrelease formulation or 100 mg q12h or q8h slowrelease formulation and in prophylaxis 50100 mg q24h is recommended With this background we summarized the NF data available as a valuable choice in the treatment of acute urinary infection but due to the longterm side effects of this drug especially in elderly patients it is essential to introduce some criteria for prescribing NF in cases of chronic UTI NF is a redoxactive antibacterial agent with the molecular formula of C8H6N4O5 and the molecular weight of 23816 and is an oral antibiotic based on nitrofurans NF which is a member of the nitrofuran family composed of a furan ring fivemembered aromatic ring with four carbon C atoms and one oxygen O is directly linked to a nitro group NO2 FDA Macrodantin NF Macrocrystals Capsules Product Information Cincinnati OH USA Procter Gamble Pharmaceuticals 2009 112 Figure 1 In the market NF is available in oral forms of capsules tablets and suspension oral suspension also known as furadantin NF is often prescribed in a dose of 50100 mg 4 times a day for 5 days Table 1 summarizes these characteristics of NF In terms of PK NF quickly reaches its therapeutic concentration level so 90 of NF is quickly exerted through the urine and that is why all its therapeutic effects are restricted to the treatment of UTI NF is 8090 orally bioavailable and its bioavailability is about 388443 It has a short halflife 20 minutes is active only in the urinary tract and has no other systemic activity Also it is rapidly absorbed and eliminated with low plasma protein binding to plasma proteins or tissues It is well absorbed from the gastrointestinal tract and excreted unchanged in urine 2540 and bile It has been reported that NF can accumulate in urine with its effect enhanced by the acidic pH of urine The antibacterial activity of NF and its metabolites is improved under acid conditions Metabolites are formed by bacterial enzyme reduction but the precise structure and antibacterial activity of each metabolite remains uncertain Antibiotic NF Formula C8H6N4O5 Molecular weight 23816 Bioavailability 388443 PK 90 of NF quickly exerted through the urine Pharmacodynamics Disruption of Krebs cycle and interference in metabolism of carbohydrates biosynthesis of proteins cell wall and DNA Dosage 50100 mg 4 times a day for 5 days Clinical use Urinary tract infection Adverse effects Renal pulmonary hepatic and nerve failureDrug induced fever Most absorption of NF is done in the duodenum so the presence of food in GI tract leads to an increase in the time of gastric emptying Therefore more NF dissolves in gastric juice before it reaches the duodenum The dissolution time hypothesis is supported by the results of Naggar and Khalil who showed that absorption increased when the solubility of NF was increased by the addition of Mg2O8Si3 UTI is one of the.\n",

formed covalent bond between the drug and the polymer matrices was confirmed by 1HNMR and FTIR studies A drug content 156 and 102 mole in the macromolecular conjugates has been determined The obtained macromolecular products have been subjected to further in vitro release studies The total percentage of ampicillin released after 21 days of incubation was nearly 60 and 14 and this resulted from the

injury and death of neurons and other cell types Identification of novel therapeutic targets and development of drugs against secondary injury by preserving the BBB integrity could be revolutionary in the care of head trauma patients Matrix metalloproteinases MMPs belongs to a family of endopeptidases that collectively cleave the constituents of the extracellular matrix MMP9 is a ubiquitous proteolytic enzyme that play a significant role in new blood vessels formation angiogenesis wound healing and embryonic development along with a litany of other cellular and physiological processes In the brain MMP9 is present at relatively low levels in normal conditions but significantly increases its expression and activity acutely following TBI Enhanced MMP9 enzymatic activity leads to damage of the BBB tight junctions by targeting the tight junction proteins resulting in barrier dysfunction and further neuroinflammation Doxycycline a tetracycline antibiotic and known for its broadspectrum coverage has been shown to inhibit MMP9 activity in traumatic processes such as in thermal injury but its potential effect on BBB breakdown and brain edema is not known Doxycycline is.\n",
      "Nitrofurantoin properties and potential in treatment of urinary tract infection a narrative review Nitrofurantoin NF a widespectrum antibiotic accessible since 1953 is utilized widely to treat urinary tract infections as it usually stays active against drugresistant uropathogen The use of Nitrofurantoin has increased exponentially since new guidelines have repositioned it as firstline therapy for uncomplicated lower urinary tract infection UTI To although fluoroquinolones are usually used to reevaluate the first and secondline therapies for treating uncomplicated UTI their level of utilization is thought to be inappropriately excessive and will eventually have a detrimental impact thus we hypothesize that NF might be the best choice for this condition because of its low frequency of utilization and its high susceptibility in common UTI pathogens It can be concluded from this review that NF can be considered as the most effective drug in the treatment of acute urinary infection but due to the longterm side effects of this drug especially in elderly patients it is essential to introduce some criteria for prescribing NF in cases of chronic UTI Nitrofurantoin NF was identified in 1953 and was first recommended for the treatment of cystitis in 2010 according to the Infectious Diseases Society of America IDSA guideline Currently 150 million Urinary Tract Infections UTIs are reported annually worldwide and drugresistant infections usually require more complex treatment regimens and are more likely to occur if treatment fails NF is outstanding because NF is most extensively utilized in humans and its effectiveness in the treatment of lower UTIs and prophylaxis is well established It is presently prescribed as firstline UTI medical care due to the emergence of resistance to different antibiotics such as carbapenem resistance It has bacteriostatic and bactericidal effects and is instantly excreted in high concentrations by the kidneys NF is bacteriostatic in low concentrations 510 pgmL and bactericidal in higher concentrations Other studies refer to the therapeutic or prophylactic use of this antibiotic In therapeutic application 50100 mg q6h regularrelease formulation or 100 mg q12h or q8h slowrelease formulation and in prophylaxis 50100 mg q24h is recommended With this background we summarized the NF data available as a valuable choice in the treatment of acute urinary infection but due to the longterm side effects of this drug especially in elderly patients it is essential to introduce some criteria for prescribing NF in cases of chronic UTI NF is a redoxactive antibacterial agent with the molecular formula of C8H6N4O5 and the molecular weight of 23816 and is an oral antibiotic based on nitrofurans NF which is a member of the nitrofuran family composed of a furan ring fivemembered aromatic ring with four carbon C atoms and one oxygen O is directly linked to a nitro group NO2 FDA Macrodantin NF Macrocrystals Capsules Product Information Cincinnati OH USA Procter Gamble Pharmaceuticals 2009 112 Figure 1 In the market NF is available in oral forms of capsules tablets and suspension oral suspension also known as furadantin NF is often prescribed in a dose of 50100 mg 4 times a day for 5 days Table 1 summarizes these characteristics of NF In terms of PK NF quickly reaches its therapeutic concentration level so 90 of NF is quickly exerted through the urine and that is why all its therapeutic effects are restricted to the treatment of UTI NF is 8090 orally bioavailable and its bioavailability is about 388443 It has a short halflife 20 minutes is active only in the urinary tract and has no other systemic activity Also it is rapidly absorbed and eliminated with low plasma protein binding to plasma proteins or tissues It is well absorbed from the gastrointestinal tract and excreted unchanged in urine 2540 and bile It has been reported that NF can accumulate in urine with its effect enhanced by the acidic pH of urine The antibacterial activity of NF and its metabolites is improved under acid conditions Metabolites are formed by bacterial enzyme reduction but the precise structure and antibacterial activity of each metabolite remains uncertain Antibiotic NF Formula C8H6N4O5 Molecular weight 23816 Bioavailability 388443 PK 90 of NF quickly exerted through the urine Pharmacodynamics Disruption of Krebs cycle and interference in metabolism of carbohydrates biosynthesis of proteins cell wall and DNA Dosage 50100 mg 4 times a day for 5 days Clinical use Urinary tract infection Adverse effects Renal pulmonary hepatic and nerve failureDrug induced fever Most absorption of NF is done in the duodenum so the presence of food in GI tract leads to an increase in the time of gastric emptying Therefore more NF dissolves in gastric juice before it reaches the duodenum The dissolution time hypothesis is supported by the results of Naggar and Khalil who showed that absorption increased when the solubility of NF was increased by the addition of Mg2O8Si3 UTI is one of the. \n",
