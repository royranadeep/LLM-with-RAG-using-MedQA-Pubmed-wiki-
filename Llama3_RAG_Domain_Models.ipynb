       "  'Clearly a substantial proportion of adults experience pain related to OA during their lifetime Further individuals with OA in one joint will often have OA in another joints with resulting greater symptomatic burden of the disease',\n",
       "  'The International Association for the Study of Pain defines pain as an unpleasant sensory and emotional experience associated with actual or potential tissue damage or described in terms of such damage It is a complex subjective phenomenon with each individual having a unique perception of it influenced by biological psychological and social factors Under normal circumstances pain is a warning that something is wrong pain from touching a hot stove having injured a joint or chest pain due to ischemia for example In these instances pain plays a protective role signaling to the individual to withdraw from the threat rest to allow tissue healing or seek help etc However once its warning role is over persistence or continued pain ie chronic pain is considered maladaptive',\n",
       "  'Unlike many other pain conditions in which the underlying injury typically heals or resolves OA is a disease that does not resolve Thus OA is typically accompanied by chronic pain Whether and to what degree this ongoing chronic pain i plays an important nociceptive role ii represents maladaptive pain or iii reflects other aspects of the pain experience is not clear',\n",
       "  'The pain experience among persons with OA has been evaluated through a number of qualitative research efforts In the first qualitative study to focus explicitly on pain and related distress as well as changes in pain over time by Hawker et al individuals with hip and knee OA identified two distinct types of OA pain one that was intermittent but generally severe or intense and another that was a persistent background pain or aching Stages of OArelated pain could be discerned with early stages characterized by activityrelated pain becoming more constant over time and punctuated by intermittent intense pain A decrease in participation subsequently occurs in an attempt to avoid triggering such episodes The more intense but less frequent pain that comes and goes ie intermittent particularly when unpredictable had greater impact on quality of life than the background ie constant pain The pain had negative effects on mood participation in social and recreational activities and sleep Similar findings were noted in another study of individuals who had a recent diagnosis of knee OA or were symptomatic but undiagnosed ie prediagnostic knee OA The significance of intermittent knee symptoms was not clear for several years before participants became aware of development of chronic knee symptoms They then altered activities to avoid more symptoms until symptoms affected participation at which time they sought medical care',\n",
       "  'In addition to the concepts of intermittent and constant pain the intensity of daily pain varies widely although the underlying reasons for such variation are not wellunderstood The quality of pain in OA also varies with approximately onethird of individuals with knee OA using descriptors such as burning tingling numbness and pins and needles to characterize their knee symptoms Such descriptors suggest that neuropathic pain may contribute to the OA pain experience although specific nerve lesions have not been identified in OA',\n",
       "  'Given the variation in pain intensity frequency pattern and quality in OA a single simple question about pain is unlikely to adequately capture the full pain experience Some of the variation in reported prevalence of symptomatic OA is related to differences in study design and populations examined but importantly it is also due to the way in which questions about knee pain were formulated Differences in descriptors used to assess pain eg pain vs pain aching or stiffness may elicit different responses Duration over which pain is being assessed eg pain on most days of a month in the past year vs pain on most days of the past month can be prone to recall bias Ideally uniform standardized and valid questionnaires should be used to evaluate pain particularly to enable more precise pain phenotyping and facilitate crossstudy comparisons genetic association studies and drug trial protocol development',\n",
       "  'In OA cohort studies and trials a number of approaches are typically used to assess pain For evaluation of knee OA pain the most common are a visual analog scale VAS or numerical rating scale NRS assessment of pain intensity a single question about presence of pain aching of stiffness in or around the knee over a specified period of time andor the pain subscale of the Western Ontario and McMaster Universities Arthritis Index WOMAC or the Knee injury and Osteoarthritis Outcome Score KOOS The pain subscales of these latter two instruments assess pain experienced with specific activities As a result the pain and function subscale scores are highly correlated Nonetheless these validated instruments are responsive and are used in assessing efficacy of interventions A number of additional validated generic pain instruments are available that are also appropriate for use in OA A metaanalysis concluded that different patientreported outcome measures of pain severity have generally comparable responsiveness to treatment with the singleitem pain assessments with the VAS or NRS resulting in effect estimates comparable to the WOMAC pain subscale although their mean standardized effect sizes were lower To enable meaningful interpretation of response to therapy rather than relying on mean group responses the OMERACTOARSI set of responder criteria were developed and validated for use in clinical trials To be considered a responder at least a minimum threshold of relative and absolute improvement in pain or a lesser degree of absolute and relative improvement in at least 2 out of 3 domains pain function patient global assessment is required Many of these same questions and instruments eg WOMAC can be used for hip OA the Hip disability and Osteoarthritis Outcome Score HOOS is specific for hip OA To assess pain stiffness and physical functioning in hand OA the AustralianCanadian Osteoarthritis Hand Index AUSCAN is commonly used',\n",
       "  'Despite widespread use of these pain assessments the complex pain experience of those living with OA is not adequately captured by existing measures To address this issue a multicenter international OARSIOMERACT initiative led to development of a new measure informed by qualitative research findings that was subsequently validated This new instrument ICOAP Intermittent and Constant OA Pain assesses various facets regarding both intermittent and constant pain for the knee and hip separately including frequency for intermittent pain intensity effects on sleep and quality of life degree of frustration or annoyance and upset or worried feelings associated with the pain as well as whether the intermittent pain occurs without warning or after a trigger The ICOAP has recently been demonstrated to be responsive to change in intervention studies',\n",
       "  'In keeping with the acknowledgement of the multidimensional nature of pain the Initiative on Methods Measurement and Pain Assessment in Clinical Trials IMMPACT has recommended six core domains and associated measures that should be considered when studying any type of chronic pain in clinical trials pain intensity and use of rescue medications physical functioning with a focus on pain interference emotional functioning participant ratings of improvement and satisfaction with treatment symptoms and adverse events and participant disposition Other domains related to pain in OA include fatigue sleep and cognition With the increasing importance of patientreported outcomes the NIHfunded Patient Reported Outcomes Measurement Information System PROMIS provides an opportunity to collect a variety of validated patientreported health outcomes related to physical mental and social wellbeing in addition to pain',\n",
       "  'In view of the complex multidimensional nature of the pain experience in OA it is perhaps not surprising that the underlying etiology of pain is multifactorial most often considered in a biopsychosocial framework Figure 1 A few such risk factors are discussed below',\n",
       "  'The extent to which structural pathology in OA contributes to the pain experience has been controversial A structuresymptom discordance in OA has been widely noted based upon observations of weak correlations between radiographic severity of OA and pain presence or severity although the discordance is less with more severe stages of radiographic disease In a systematic review 1576 of those with knee pain had radiographic OA and 1581 of those with radiographic OA had knee pain The extent of additional xray views obtained the definition of pain symptoms and the nature of the study sample eg age race affected the prevalence of these findings and therefore interpretation of the degree of concordance For example in studies evaluating both the tibiofemoral and patellofemoral joints that also obtained WOMAC pain assessments a more consistent association was noted between pain severity and radiographic OA Supporting such findings a randomized trial demonstrated intraarticular lidocaine to effectively decrease knee pain in comparison with placebo lending further support to the notion that structural pathology within the knee must be contributing to pain',\n",
       "  'Beyond measurement issues there are additional reasons that contribute to an apparent discordance As discussed above pain is a subjective experience influenced by a number of factors including genetic predisposition prior experience expectations about analgesic treatment current mood coping strategies and catastrophizing and sociocultural environment as some examples Without taking into account such factors that can contribute to betweenperson differences assessment of the relation of structure to symptoms will be confounded Unfortunately most such factors that contribute to individual variation in pain cannot be feasibly measured or collected in most studies By adequately controlling for betweenperson differences using a withinperson kneematched approach a strong doseresponse relationship can be demonstrated between radiographic severity and pain presence severity and incidence ie new onset',\n",

       "  'Weight is a potential modifiable factor contributing not only to OA risk but also to pain The effect of obesity on pain may be twofold For the lower extremities the effect of excess weights on symptoms may be due to mechanical loading Increased relative fat mass in obesity may potentially contribute to pain symptoms related to elaboration of adipokines although studies are conflicting in this regard While the mechanism by which obesity contributes to pain may not be clear effects of altering weight on OArelated pain have been studied Observational cohort data was used to demonstrate a lower risk of developing symptomatic knee OA among women who lost 5kg Subsequent randomized trials have noted reductions in pain with 10 weight loss with more substantial effects on pain reduction with greater weight loss Importantly weight gain significantly increases pain highlighting the doseresponse relationship of change in weight with change in pain',\n",

       "  'Another area that may provide potential therapeutic targets is related to risk factors that contribute to the transition from acute to chronic pain in OA which at present is not wellunderstood As noted in the qualitative work described above there is a general progression of symptoms from the early stages of OA with activityrelated eg weightbearing symptoms that appear to be nociceptive in nature to a more persistent constant pain that likely reflects other additional processes such as neurobiological mechanisms Tissue injury andor inflammation as may be seen in OA leads to a decrease in the excitation threshold and an increase in responsiveness to suprathreshold stimuli of peripheral nociceptors ie peripheral sensitization Noxious mechanical stimuli can then evoke exaggerated responses primary hyperalgesia and normally innocuous stimuli such as movement of the joint through its normal range of motion may evoke a pain response allodynia As a result of nociceptor activity after tissue injury or inflammation a number of changes occur in the central nervous system These include changes to dorsal horn transmission neuron receptors leading the transmission neurons to become increasingly responsive to peripheral input central sensitization with reduction in the threshold for mechanically induced pain and an expansion of the receptive field of dorsal horn neurons spatial summation Radiating pain in OA likely reflects this latter phenomenon Once established central sensitization is maintained by lowlevel noxious and even nonnociceptive input from the periphery Such changes in the central nervous system are mainly responsible for the enhanced sensitivity to mechanical stimuli that develops outside the area of the injury secondary hyperalgesia',\n",
       "  'Beyond the clinical observations of hyperalgesia allodynia and radiating pain that suggest a role for sensitization in OArelated pain there are some experimental neurophysiologic findings that also support the presence of sensitization in OA Persons with knee OA experience a greater intensity duration and area of hyperalgesia after intramuscular injection of hypertonic saline compared with controls Lidocaine injected into a painful OA knee resulted in pain reduction in both the injected knee and the untreated contralateral knee supporting central pain modulation in OA Persons with knee OA have higher pain intensities compared with controls to the same level of pressure stimuli as well as lower pressure pain thresholds Other studies have also documented lower pain thresholds in persons with OA compared with controls Temporal summation a progressive increase in discharges of dorsal horn neurons in response to repetitive afferent stimulation thought to reflect central sensitization is increased in persons with painful knee OA compared with agematched healthy controls and the degree of sensitization correlated with pain What pathologies of OA may contribute to peripheral andor central sensitization other risk factors for sensitization and identification of the transition from appropriate nociceptive input to sensitization are important research questions that need to be addressed for improved understanding of pain mechanisms in OA In addition further development and validation of tools to assess sensitization will be necessary to support such research efforts',\n",
       "  'Thus there appears to be substantial opportunities to gain further insights into causes and contributors to pain in OA Such insights in turn will provide opportunities for rational mechanismbased targeting of pain for more efficacious therapeutic management of OA patients',\n",

       "  'To appreciate the total economic burden of OA on society indirect or productivity costs must also be examined Productivity costs typically reflect costs due to lost productivity while being present at work costs due to absence from work and costs for compensation of household work by others Unfortunately there are significant variations among indirect cost studies in OA regarding methodology cost estimation and cost presentation limiting ones ability to determine the magnitude of OAs economic impact For example in one review indirect costs of OA per patient per year varied from 831 in Hong Kong to 12789 in Canada costs in 2006 USD Considering the prevalence of OA workrelated OA costs have been estimated to range from 34 to 132 billion per year Estimates from 1999 indicate that adults with knee OA reported more than 13 days of lost work due to health issues Using a more recent large US employer benefits database those with OA had an average of 63 days of absenteeism compared with 37 days among a matched comparator group with mean total direct and indirect costs being 2 to 3fold higher Similar findings were noted in a Swedish populationbased cohort in which those with physiciandiagnosed knee OA had a 2fold increased risk of sick leave and 4050 increased risk of disability pension compared with the general population Further 2 of all sick days in the population were attributable to knee OA In a systematic literature review regarding work participation occupational limitations and reduced work capacity or job effectiveness were reported more frequently in those with OA than by controls Aggregate annual absenteeism costs of OA were estimated to be 10 billion from the US Medical Expenditure Panel Survey higher than many other major chronic diseases Taking into account both productivity costs and medical costs among adults with paid employment in a study from the Netherlands the total economic burden of knee OA was estimated to be 871 per person per month with the majority of the costs being related to productivity Regardless of the methodologic differences issues with cost estimation and difficulties in comparing costs across studies it is clear that OA has a tremendous economic impact that will only continue to grow with its rising prevalence',\n",
