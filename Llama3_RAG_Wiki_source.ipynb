       "'Arthralgia from Greek arthro joint and algos pain literally means joint pain Specifically arthralgia is a symptom of injury infection illness in particular arthritis or an allergic reaction to medication According to MeSH the term arthralgia should only be used when the condition is noninflammatory and the term arthritis should be used when the condition is inflammatory Causes The causes of arthralgia are varied and range from a joints perspective from degenerative and destructive processes such as osteoarthritis and sports injuries to inflammation of tissues surrounding the joints such as bursitis These might be triggered by other things such as infections or vaccinations Diagnosis Diagnosis involves interviewing the patient and performing physical exams When attempting to establish the cause of the arthralgia the emphasis is on the interview The patient is asked questions intended to narrow the number of potential causes Given the varied nature of these possible causes some questions may seem irrelevant For example the patient may be asked about dry mouth light sensitivity rashes or a history of seizures Answering yes or no to any of these questions limits the number of possible causes and guides the physician toward the appropriate exams and lab tests Treatment Treatment depends on a specific underlying cause The underlying cause will be treated first and foremost The treatments may include joint replacement surgery for severely damaged joints immunosuppressants for immune system dysfunction antibiotics when an infection is the cause and discontinuing medication when an allergic reaction is the cause When treating the primary cause pain management may still play a role in treatment See also Antiarthritics Myalgia ReferencesCompression arthralgia is pain in the joints caused by exposure to high ambient pressure at a relatively high rate of compression experienced by underwater divers Also referred to in the US Navy Diving Manual as compression pains Compression arthralgia has been recorded as deep aching pain in the knees shoulders fingers back hips neck and ribs Pain may be sudden and intense in onset and may be accompanied by a feeling of roughness in the joints Onset commonly occurs around 60 msw meters of sea water and symptoms are variable depending on depth compression rate and personal susceptibility Intensity increases with depth and may be aggravated by exercise Compression arthralgia is generally a problem of deep diving particularly deep saturation diving where at sufficient depth even slow compression may produce symptoms Peter B Bennett et al 1974 found that the use of trimix could reduce the symptoms Fast compression descent may produce symptoms as shallow as 30 msw Saturation divers generally compress much more slowly and symptoms are unlikely at less than around 90 msw At depths beyond 180m even very slow compression may produce symptoms Spontaneous improvement may occur over time at depth but this is unpredictable and pain may persist into decompression Symptoms may be distinguished from decompression sickness as they are present before starting decompression and resolve with decreasing pressure the opposite of decompression sickness The pain may be sufficiently severe to limit the divers capacity for work and may also limit travel rate and depth of downward excursions Mechanism The mechanism of compression arthralgia is not known Treatment The symptoms generally resolve during decompression and require no further treatment ReferencesPolymer fume fever or fluoropolymer fever also informally called Teflon flu is an inhalation fever caused by the fumes released when polytetrafluoroethylene PTFE known under the trade name Teflon reaches temperatures of 300 C 572 F to 450 C 842 F Fever When PTFE is heated above 450 C the pyrolysis products are different and inhalation may cause acute lung injury Symptoms are flulike chills headaches and fevers with chest tightness and mild cough Onset occurs about 4 to 8 hours after exposure to the pyrolysis products of PTFE A high white blood cell count may be seen and chest xray findings are usually minimal The polymer fumes are especially harmful to certain animals whose breathing optimized for rapidity allows in toxins which are excluded by human lungs Fumes from Teflon in very high heat are fatal to parrots as well as some other birds PTFE toxicosis See also Cooking oilCooking with oil Metal fume fever References Further reading Shusterman DJ 1993 Polymer fume fever and other fluorocarbon pyrolysisrelated syndromes Occup Med 8 3 51931 PMID 8272977 External linksSerum sicknesslike reactions SSLRs refer to adverse reactions that have symptoms similar to those of serum sickness type III immune complex hypersensitivity but in which immune complexes are not found 127 Causes Agents that have been implicated in serum sicknesslike reactions include cefaclor amoxicillin sulfonamides tetracyclines ciprofloxacin nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drugs barbiturates carbamazepine propranolol thiouracil and allopurinol Metabolites of these drugs might bind with tissue proteins inappropriately eliciting an acute inflammatory response that typically develops 714 days after initiation of the offending agent Acute hepatitis B will sometimes be complicated with this syndrome which often resolves with the onset of jaundice Pathogenesis Serum sicknesslike reaction is named for its clinical similarity to serum sickness in which immune complexes are deposited in the skin joints and other organs True serum sickness a type III hypersensitivity reaction results in fever lymphadenopathy arthralgias cutaneous eruptions gastrointestinal disturbances proteinuria and significant decreases in serum complement levels it was originally described after patients were infused with equine immunoglobulins In contrast serum sicknesslike reactions are specific drug reactions that are not associated with circulating immune complexes Although the exact pathogenesis is poorly understood serum sicknesslike reactions are thought to originate from an abnormal inflammatory reaction that occurs in response to defective metabolism of drug byproducts generated during pharmacologic therapy the metabolic flaw could be a maternallyinherited trait In vivo hepatic drug biotransformation studies have shown greater lymphocyte killing in subjects with a known history of serum sicknesslike reactions than in control subjects Diagnosis The reaction generally includes a constellation of fever urticarial polycyclic wheals a rash that can look similar to hives with small swellings that overlap each other with central clearing on the trunk extremities face and lateral borders of the hands and feet oral edema without mucosal involvement lymphadenopathy arthralgias myalgias and mild proteinuria Case reports have noted the absence of fever in serum sicknesslike reactions to amoxicillin Laboratory abnormalities include normal or mild decreases in serum C3 C4 and CH50 levels and mild proteinuria In contrast to true serum sickness renal and hepatic involvement is rare Significant decreases in serum C3 C4 and CH50 reported in the literature for true serum sickness are rarely described in serum sicknesslike reaction Management Serum sicknesslike reaction is an acute selflimited reaction with an ultimately favorable outcome Treatment is typically symptomatic but hospitalization may be required for severe cases While optimal treatment strategies for serum sicknesslike reactions are not clearly defined in the literature discontinuation of the suspected agent combined with use of antihistamines corticosteroids and NSAIDs for symptom control is an appropriate therapeutic route Case reports have shown that treatment with prednisone 60 mg daily and high doses of H1 and H2 antihistamines help resolve the arthralgias and myalgias within 24 hours and the remaining symptoms within 4872 hours See also List of cutaneous conditions Citations General and cited references Mener DJ Negrini C Blatt A Itching like mad American Journal of Medicine 2009 8122 732734Adultonset Stills disease AOSD is a form of Stills disease a rare systemic autoinflammatory disease characterized by the classic triad of fevers joint pain and a distinctive salmoncolored bumpy rash The disease is considered a diagnosis of exclusion Levels of the ironbinding protein ferritin may be extremely elevated with this disorder AOSD may present in a similar manner to other inflammatory diseases and to autoimmune diseases which must be ruled out before making the diagnosis Prognosis is usually favorable but manifestations of the disease affecting the lungs heart or kidneys may occasionally cause severe lifethreatening complications It is treated first with corticosteroids such as prednisone Medications that block the action of interleukin1 such as anakinra can be effective treatments when standard steroid treatments are insufficient Obvious similarities exist with juvenile rheumatoid arthritis also known as juvenileonset Stills disease and there is some evidence that the two conditions are closely related Signs and symptoms The disease typically presents with joint pain high fevers a salmonpink macular or maculopapular rash enlargement of the liver and spleen swollen lymph nodes and a neutrophilpredominant increased white blood cell count in the blood Tests for rheumatoid factor and antinuclear antibodies are usually negative and serum ferritin is markedly elevated Patients experiencing a flareup from adultonset Stills disease usually report extreme fatigue swelling of the lymph nodes and less commonly fluid accumulation in the lungs and heart In rare cases AOSD can cause lifethreatening complications including hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis IVDC fulminant hepatitis or disabling conditions such as aseptic meningitis and sensorineural hearing loss Pathophysiology The cause of adultonset Stills disease is unknown and it is not heritable but it presumably involves interleukin1 IL1 since medications that block the action of IL1β are effective treatments Interleukin18 is expressed at high levels Diagnosis The diagnosis is clinical not based upon serology At least seven sets of diagnostic criteria have been devised however the Yamaguchi criteria have the highest sensitivity Diagnosis requires at least five features with at least two of these being major diagnostic criteria Classification People with AOSD generally experience one of two patterns in the disease a debilitating pattern of fevers joint pain and other systemic symptoms or a somewhat less aggressive pattern in which the main symptom is chronic joint pain and arthritis One set of 21 adultonset Stills disease patients were divided into four types according to clinical course patterns These included monocyclic systemic disease polycyclic systemic disease chronic articular monocyclic systemic disease and chronic articular polycyclic systemic disease People with chronic articular and polyarticular disease were at higher risk to develop disabling arthritis Treatment Adultonset Stills disease is treated with antiinflammatory medications Steroids such as prednisone are used to treat severe symptoms of Stills Other commonly used medications include hydroxychloroquine penicillamine azathioprine methotrexate etanercept anakinra tocilizumab cyclophosphamide adalimumab rituximab and infliximab Newer medications target interleukin1 IL1 particularly IL1β A randomized multicenter trial reported better outcomes in a group of 12 patients treated with anakinra than in a group of 10 patients taking other diseasemodifying antirheumatic drugs In June 2020 FDA approved Ilaris canakinumab for the treatment of AOSD this is the first FDA approved treatment for AOSD Canakinumab is another antiIL1 drug which selectively binds IL1β and rilonacept which blocks both IL1A and IL1β The monoclonal antiIL6 antibody tocilizumab is another treatment option as effective as anakinra The condition juvenileonset Stills disease is now usually grouped under juvenile rheumatoid arthritis However there are obvious similarities between the two conditions and there is some evidence that they may be closely related Epidemiology Adultonset Stills disease is rare and has been described all over the world The number of new cases per year is estimated to be 16 per 1000000 population The number of people currently affected is estimated at 15 cases per 1000001000000 population Onset is most common in two age ranges between ages 1625 and between ages of 3646 years History Stills disease is named after English physician Sir George Frederic Still 18611941 The adultonset version was characterized by E G Bywaters in 1971 Research directions Researchers are investigating whether levels of a protein named calprotectin could be used to improve diagnosis and monitoring See also Juvenile idiopathic arthritis The Big Sick References External links Adultonset Stills disease Genetic and Rare Diseases Information Center GARD Archived from the

       "'Ampicillin is an antibiotic belonging to the aminopenicillin class of the penicillin family The drug is used to prevent and treat a number of bacterial infections such as respiratory tract infections urinary tract infections meningitis salmonellosis and endocarditis It may also be used to prevent group B streptococcal infection in newborns It is used by mouth by injection into a muscle or intravenously Common side effects include rash nausea and diarrhea It should not be used in people who are allergic to penicillin Serious side effects may include Clostridium difficile colitis or anaphylaxis While usable in those with kidney problems the dose may need to be decreased Its use during pregnancy and breastfeeding appears to be generally safe Ampicillin was discovered in 1958 and came into commercial use in 1961 It is on the World Health Organizations List of Essential Medicines The World Health Organization classifies ampicillin as critically important for human medicine It is available as a generic medication Medical uses Diseases Bacterial meningitis an aminoglycoside can be added to increase efficacy against gramnegative meningitis bacteria Endocarditis by enterococcal strains offlabel use often given with an aminoglycoside Gastrointestinal infections caused by contaminated water or food for example by Salmonella Genitourinary tract infections Healthcareassociated infections that are related to infections from using urinary catheters and that are unresponsive to other medications Otitis media middle ear infection Prophylaxis ie to prevent infection in those who previously had rheumatic heart disease or are undergoing dental procedures vaginal hysterectomies or Csections It is also used in pregnant woman who are carriers of group B streptococci to prevent earlyonset neonatal infections Respiratory infections including bronchitis pharyngitis Sinusitis Sepsis Whooping cough to prevent and treat secondary infections Ampicillin used to also be used to treat gonorrhea but there are now too many strains resistant to penicillins Bacteria Ampicillin is used to treat infections by many grampositive and gramnegative bacteria It was the first broad spectrum penicillin with activity against grampositive bacteria including Streptococcus pneumoniae Streptococcus pyogenes some isolates of Staphylococcus aureus but not penicillinresistant or methicillinresistant strains Trueperella and some Enterococcus It is one of the few antibiotics that works against multidrug resistant Enterococcus faecalis and E faecium Activity against gramnegative bacteria includes Neisseria meningitidis some Haemophilus influenzae and some of the Enterobacteriaceae though most Enterobacteriaceae and Pseudomonas are resistant Its spectrum of activity is enhanced by coadministration of sulbactam a drug that inhibits beta lactamase an enzyme produced by bacteria to inactivate ampicillin and related antibiotics It is sometimes used in combination with other antibiotics that have different mechanisms of action like vancomycin linezolid daptomycin and tigecycline Available forms Ampicillin can be administered by mouth an intramuscular injection shot or by intravenous infusion The oral form available as capsules or oral suspensions is not given as an initial treatment for severe infections but rather as a followup to an IM or IV injection For IV and IM injections ampicillin is kept as a powder that must be reconstituted IV injections must be given slowly as rapid IV injections can lead to convulsive seizures Specific populations Ampicillin is one of the most used drugs in pregnancy and has been found to be generally harmless both by the Food and Drug Administration in the US which classified it as category B and the Therapeutic Goods Administration in Australia which classified it as category A It is the drug of choice for treating Listeria monocytogenes in pregnant women either alone or combined with an aminoglycoside Pregnancy increases the clearance of ampicillin by up to 50 and a higher dose is thus needed to reach therapeutic levels Ampicillin crosses the placenta and remains in the amniotic fluid at 50100 of the concentration in maternal plasma this can lead to high concentrations of ampicillin in the newborn While lactating mothers secrete some ampicillin into their breast milk the amount is minimal In newborns ampicillin has a longer halflife and lower plasma protein binding The clearance by the kidneys is lower as kidney function has not fully developed Contraindications Ampicillin is contraindicated in those with a hypersensitivity to penicillins as they can cause fatal anaphylactic reactions Hypersensitivity reactions can include frequent skin rashes and hives exfoliative dermatitis erythema multiforme and a temporary decrease in both red and white blood cells Ampicillin is not recommended in people with concurrent mononucleosis as over 40 of patients develop a skin rash Side effects Ampicillin is comparatively less toxic than other antibiotics and side effects are more likely in those who are sensitive to penicillins and those with a history of asthma or allergies In very rare cases it causes severe side effects such as angioedema anaphylaxis and C difficile infection that can range from mild diarrhea to serious pseudomembranous colitis Some develop black furry tongue Serious adverse effects also include seizures and serum sickness The most common side effects experienced by about 10 of users are diarrhea and rash Less common side effects can be nausea vomiting itching and blood dyscrasias The gastrointestinal effects such as hairy tongue nausea vomiting diarrhea and colitis are more common with the oral form of penicillin Other conditions may develop up several weeks after treatment Overdose Ampicillin overdose can cause behavioral changes confusion blackouts and convulsions as well as neuromuscular hypersensitivity electrolyte imbalance and kidney failure Interactions Ampicillin reacts with probenecid and methotrexate to decrease renal excretion Large doses of ampicillin can increase the risk of bleeding with concurrent use of warfarin and other oral anticoagulants possibly by inhibiting platelet aggregation Ampicillin has been said to make oral contraceptives less effective but this has been disputed It can be made less effective by other antibiotic such as chloramphenicol erythromycin cephalosporins and tetracyclines For example tetracyclines inhibit protein synthesis in bacteria reducing the target against which ampicillin acts If given at the same time as aminoglycosides it can bind to it and inactivate it When administered separately aminoglycosides and ampicillin can potentiate each other instead Ampicillin causes skin rashes more often when given with allopurinol Both the live.\\nCeftriaxone sold under the brand name Rocephin is a thirdgeneration cephalosporin antibiotic used for the treatment of a number of bacterial infections These include middle ear infections endocarditis meningitis pneumonia bone and joint infections intraabdominal infections skin infections urinary tract infections gonorrhea and pelvic inflammatory disease It is also sometimes used before surgery and following a bite wound to try to prevent infection Ceftriaxone can be given by injection into a vein or into a muscle Common side effects include pain at the site of injection and allergic reactions Other possible side effects include C difficileassociated diarrhea hemolytic anemia gall bladder disease and seizures It is not recommended in those who have had anaphylaxis to penicillin but may be used in those who have had milder reactions The intravenous form should not be given with intravenous calcium There is tentative evidence that ceftriaxone is relatively safe during pregnancy and breastfeeding It is a thirdgeneration cephalosporin that works by preventing bacteria from making a cell wall Ceftriaxone was patented in 1978 and approved for medical use in 1982 It is on the World Health Organizations List of Essential Medicines It is available as a generic medication Medical use Ceftriaxone and other thirdgeneration cephalosporin antibiotics are used to treat organisms that tend to be resistant to many other antibiotics Due to emergent resistance ceftriaxone should not be used for the treatment of Enterobacter infections Before using ceftriaxone it is important to determine the susceptibility of the bacteria If sepsis is being considered empiric therapy may be initiated prior to susceptibility testing Medical uses include lower respiratory tract infections acute bacterial otitis media skin and skin structure infections urinary tract infections uncomplicated gonorrhea pelvic inflammatory disease bacterial sepsis intraabdominal infections meningitis surgical prophylaxis Lyme disease Ceftriaxone is also a choice drug for treatment of bacterial meningitis caused by pneumococci meningococci Haemophilus influenzae and susceptible enteric Gramnegative rods but not Listeria monocytogenes In combination with doxycycline or azithromycin ceftriaxone used to be recommended by the United States Centers for Disease Control and Prevention CDC for the treatment of uncomplicated gonorrhea Due to increased risk of developing azithromycin resistant strains and the high efficacy of higher doses of ceftriaxone the guidance has been updated to monoantibiotic therapy with a higher dose of ceftriaxone Spectrum of activity Like other thirdgeneration cephalosporins ceftriaxone is active against Citrobacter spp Serratia marcescens and betalactamaseproducing strains of Haemophilus and Neisseria However unlike ceftazidime and cefoperazone ceftriaxone does not have useful activity against Pseudomonas aeruginosa It is generally not active against Enterobacter species and its use should be avoided in the treatment of Enterobacter infections even if the isolate appears susceptible because of the emergence of resistance Some organisms such as Citrobacter Providencia and Serratia have the ability to become resistant through the development of cephalosporinases enzymes that hydrolyze cephalosporins and render them inactive Although not being used as first line therapy against Staphylococcus aureus ceftriaxone retains activity against isolates of methicillinsusceptible S aureus and is used in clinic for infections sustained by this bacterium In this case the dose should be doubled eg 2 g intravenously every 12 hours Available forms Ceftriaxone is available for administration via the intramuscular or the intravenous routes Ceftriaxone is stored as a dry powder in a vial and is reconstituted dissolved immediately before use The solution is used promptly after preparation still reconstituted solutions retain their physical and chemical stability for 24 hours at 25C or for 3 days when stored between 2 and 8C The solutions are pale yellowish in color but the change of color to amber or reddish suggests hydrolysis of the amide bond of the βlactam ring thereby affecting the antimicrobial activity of the antibiotic Diluents containing calcium are not used to reconstitute ceftriaxone and it must not be administered in intravenous lines containing other calciumcontaining solutions as a ceftriaxonecalcium precipitate could form This precipitation risk is particularly high in newborns up to age 28 days especially if they are premature or have impaired bilirubin binding Specific populations Pregnancy Ceftriaxone is pregnancy category B It has not been observed to cause birth defects in animal studies but a lack of wellcontrolled studies done in pregnant women exists Breastfeeding Low concentrations of ceftriaxone are excreted in breast milk that are not expected to cause adverse effects in breastfed infants The manufacturer recommends that caution be exercised when administering ceftriaxone to women who breastfeed Newborns Hyperbilirubinemic neonates are contraindicated for the use of ceftriaxone It can compete with bilirubin and displace it from binding to albumin increasing the risk of bilirubin encephalopathy Elderly According to the package insert clinical studies did not show differences in efficacy and safety of ceftriaxone in geriatrics compared to younger patients but greater sensitivity of some older individuals cannot be ruled out Adverse effects Although generally well tolerated the most common adverse reactions associated with ceftriaxone are changes in white blood cell counts local reactions at site of administration rash and diarrhea Incidence of adverse effects greater than 1 Eosinophilia 6 Thrombocytosis 51 Elevations in liver enzymes 3133 Diarrhea 27 Leukopenia 21 Elevation in BUN 12 Local reactions pain tenderness irritation 1 Rash 17 Some less frequently reported adverse events incidence 1 include phlebitis itchiness fever chills nausea vomiting elevations of bilirubin elevations in creatinine headache and dizziness Ceftriaxone may precipitate in bile causing biliary sludge biliary pseudolithiasis and gallstones especially in children Hypoprothrombinaemia and bleeding are specific side effects Haemolysis is reported It has also been reported to cause post kidney failure in children Like other antibiotics ceftriaxone use can result in Clostridioides difficileassociated diarrhea ranging from mild diarrhea to fatal colitis In this regard it has been reported that shifting from ceftriaxone to cefotaxime would have a lower impact on C difficile infection rates since cefotaxime is almost entirely excreted by the kidneys while ceftriaxone has a 45 biliary excretion Contraindications Ceftriaxone should not be used in those with an allergy to ceftriaxone or any component of the formulation Although there is negligible crossreactivity between.\\nDoxycycline is a broadspectrum antibiotic of the tetracycline class used in the treatment of infections caused by bacteria and certain parasites It is used to treat bacterial pneumonia acne chlamydia infections Lyme disease cholera typhus and syphilis It is also used to prevent malaria Doxycycline may be taken by mouth or by injection into a vein Common side effects include diarrhea nausea vomiting abdominal pain and an increased risk of sunburn Use during pregnancy is not recommended Like other agents of the tetracycline class it either slows or kills bacteria by inhibiting protein production It kills malaria by targeting a plastid organelle the apicoplast Doxycycline was patented in 1957 and came into commercial use in 1967 It is on the World Health Organizations List of Essential Medicines Doxycycline is available as a generic medicine In 2021 it was the 82nd most commonly prescribed medication in the United States with more than 8 million prescriptions Medical uses In addition to the general indications for all members of the tetracycline antibiotics group doxycycline is frequently used to treat Lyme disease chronic prostatitis sinusitis pelvic inflammatory disease severe acne rosacea and rickettsial infections The efficiency of oral doxycycline for treating papulopustular rosacea and adult acne is not solely based on its antibiotic properties but also on its antiinflammatory and antiangiogenic properties In Canada in 2004 doxycycline was considered a firstline treatment for chlamydia and nongonococcal urethritis and with cefixime for uncomplicated gonorrhea Antibacterial General indications Doxycycline is a broadspectrum antibiotic that is employed in the treatment of numerous bacterial infections It is effective against bacteria such as Moraxella catarrhalis Brucella melitensis Chlamydia pneumoniae and Mycoplasma pneumoniae Additionally doxycycline is used in the prevention and treatment of serious conditions like anthrax leptospirosis bubonic plague and Lyme disease However some bacteria including Haemophilus spp Mycoplasma hominis and Pseudomonas aeruginosa have shown resistance to doxycycline It is also effective against Yersinia pestis the infectious agent of bubonic plague and is prescribed for the treatment of Lyme disease ehrlichiosis and Rocky Mountain spotted fever Specifically doxycycline is indicated for treatment of the following diseases Rocky Mountain spotted fever typhus fever and the typhus group scrub typhus Q fever rickettsialpox and tick fevers caused by Rickettsia respiratory tract infections caused by Mycoplasma pneumoniae Lymphogranuloma venereum trachoma inclusion conjunctivitis and uncomplicated urethral endocervical or rectal infections in adults caused by Chlamydia trachomatis psittacosis nongonococcal urethritis caused by Ureaplasma urealyticum relapsing fever due to Borrelia recurrentis chancroid caused by Haemophilus ducreyi plague due to Yersinia pestis tularemia cholera campylobacter fetus infections brucellosis caused by Brucella species in conjunction with streptomycin bartonellosis granuloma inguinale Klebsiella species Lyme disease it can be used in adults and children For treatment or prophylaxis of Lyme disease in children it can be used for a duration of up to 21 days in children of any age Doxycycline is specifically indicated to treat Lyme disease for patients presenting with erythema migrans As for the optimal duation of treatment of this disease guidelines vary with some recommending a 10day course of doxycycline while others suggest a 14day course still recent data suggest that even a 7day course of doxycycline can be effective Compared to other drugs there are no significant differences in treatment response across antibiotic agents doses or durations when comparing 14 days versus 21 days as such the optimal duration of treatment of Lyme disease remains uncertain as prolonged antibiotic courses have drawbacks including diminishing returns in terms of patient outcomes heightened risks of adverse events superinfections increased healthcare costs and the potential for development of antibiotic resistance Therefore the consensus remains to treat patients with the shortest effective duration of antibiotics as is the case with doxycycline for Lyme disease as well Gramnegative bacteria specific indications When bacteriologic testing indicates appropriate susceptibility to the drug doxycycline may be used to treat these infections caused by Gramnegative bacteria Escherichia coli infections Enterobacter aerogenes formerly Aerobacter aerogenes infections Shigella species infections Acinetobacter species formerly Mima species and Herellea species infections respiratory tract infections caused by Haemophilus influenzae respiratory tract and urinary tract infections caused by Klebsiella species Grampositive bacteria specific indications Some Grampositive bacteria have developed resistance to doxycycline Up to 44 of Streptococcus pyogenes and up to 74 of S faecalis specimens have developed resistance to the tetracycline group of antibiotics Up to 57 of P acnes strains developed resistance to doxycycline When bacteriologic testing indicates appropriate susceptibility to the drug doxycycline may be used to treat these infections caused by Grampositive bacteria upper respiratory infections caused by Streptococcus pneumoniae formerly Diplococcus pneumoniae skin and soft tissue infections caused by Staphylococcus aureus including methicillinresistant Staphylococcus aureus infections anthrax caused by Bacillus

diarrhea and headaches Rarely numbness lung problems or liver problems may occur While it appears to be generally safe during pregnancy its use is not recommended near time of delivery While it usually works by slowing bacterial growth it may result in bacterial death at the high concentrations found in urine Nitrofurantoin was first sold in 1953 It is on the World Health Organizations List of Essential Medicines It is available as a generic medication In 2021 it was the 135th most commonly prescribed medication in the United States with more than 4 million prescriptions Medical uses Uses include the treatment of uncomplicated urinary tract infections UTIs and prophylaxis against urinary tract infections in people prone to recurrent urinary tract infections Increasing bacterial antibiotic resistance to other commonly used agents such as trimethoprimsulfamethoxazole and fluoroquinolones has led to increased interest in using nitrofurantoin The efficacy of nitrofurantoin in treating urinary tract infections combined with a low rate of bacterial resistance to this agent makes it one of the firstline agents for treating uncomplicated urinary tract infections as recommended by the Infectious Diseases Society of America and the European Society for Microbiology and Infectious Diseases Nitrofurantoin is not recommended for the treatment of pyelonephritis and intraabdominal abscess because of extremely poor tissue penetration and low blood levels Antibacterial activity Nitrofurantoin has been shown to have good activity against E coli Staphylococcus saprophyticus Coagulase negative staphylococci Enterococcus faecalis Staphylococcus aureus Streptococcus agalactiae Citrobacter species Klebsiella species Bacillus subtilis species It is used in the treatment of infections caused by these organisms Many or all strains of the following genera are resistant to nitrofurantoin Enterobacter Proteus Pseudomonas Special populations Pregnancy Nitrofurantoin is pregnancy category A in Australia It is one of the few drugs commonly used in pregnancy to treat urinary tract infections There is a potential risk of hemolytic anemia in the newborn when used near time of delivery Newborns of women given this drug late in pregnancy had a higher risk of developing neonatal jaundice Evidence of safety in early pregnancy is mixed as of 2017 The American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists states that while they can be used in the first trimester other options may be preferred They remain a first line treatment in the second trimester A 2015 meta analysis found no increased risk from first trimester use in cohort studies that was a slight increase of malformations in case control studies Contraindications Nitrofurantoin is contraindicated in patients with decreased renal function CrCl 60 mlmin due to systemic accumulation and subtherapeutic levels reached in the urinary tract However a retrospective chart review suggests the data for this cutoff are slim and a cutoff of CrCl 40 mlmin would be more appropriate Many of the severe side effects of this drug are more common in the elderly and those with renal impairment as this causes the drug to be retained in the body and reach higher systemic levels Thus the drug is not recommended for the elderly population according to 2012 AGS Beers Criteria Nitrofurantoin is also contraindicated in babies up to the age of one month as they have immature enzyme systems in their red blood cells glutathione instability so nitrofurantoin must not be used because it can cause haemolytic anaemia Nitrofurantoin is contraindicated in patients with glucose6phosphate dehydrogenase deficiency G6PD because of risk of intravascular hemolysis resulting in anemia Adverse effects The most common side effects of nitrofurantoin are nausea headache and flatulence Less common adverse events occurring in less than 1 of those taking the drug include Gastrointestinal diarrhea dyspepsia abdominal pain constipation emesis Neurologic dizziness drowsiness amblyopia Respiratory acute pulmonary hypersensitivity reaction Allergic pruritus urticaria Dermatologic hair loss Miscellaneous fever chills malaise Lung toxicity The pulmonary toxicity caused by nitrofurantoin can be categorized into acute subacute and chronic pulmonary reactions The acute and subacute reactions are thought to be due to a hypersensitivity reaction and often resolve when the drug is discontinued Acute reactions have been estimated to occur in about one in 5000 women who take the drug These reactions usually develop 38 days after the first dose of nitrofurantoin but may occur from a few hours to a few weeks after starting the drug Symptoms include fever dyspnea chills cough pleuritic chest pain headache back pain and epigastric pain Chest radiograph will often show unilateral or bilateral infiltrates similar to pulmonary edema Chronic pulmonary reactions caused by nitrofurantoin include diffuse interstitial pneumonitis pulmonary fibrosis or both This uncommon reaction may occur 1 month to 6 years after starting the drug and is usually related to its total lifetime dose This reaction manifests with progressive shortness of breath It is important to recognize nitrofurantoin as possible cause of symptoms and discontinue the drug when the suspicion of pulmonary side effects arises as it can be reversible if the drug is stopped early Liver toxicity Liver reactions including hepatitis cholestatic jaundice chronic active hepatitis and hepatic necrosis occur rarely Neuropathy Neuropathy is a rare side effect of taking nitrofurantoin Patients may experience numbness and tingling in a stockingglove pattern which may or may not improve upon discontinuation of the drug Pharmacology Organisms

      "Ampicillin is an antibiotic belonging to the aminopenicillin class of the penicillin family The drug is used to prevent and treat a number of bacterial infections such as respiratory tract infections urinary tract infections meningitis salmonellosis and endocarditis It may also be used to prevent group B streptococcal infection in newborns It is used by mouth by injection into a muscle or intravenously Common side effects include rash nausea and diarrhea It should not be used in people who are allergic to penicillin Serious side effects may include Clostridium difficile colitis or anaphylaxis While usable in those with kidney problems the dose may need to be decreased Its use during pregnancy and breastfeeding appears to be generally safe Ampicillin was discovered in 1958 and came into commercial use in 1961 It is on the World Health Organizations List of Essential Medicines The World Health Organization classifies ampicillin as critically important for human medicine It is available as a generic medication Medical uses Diseases Bacterial meningitis an aminoglycoside can be added to increase efficacy against gramnegative meningitis bacteria Endocarditis by enterococcal strains offlabel use often given with an aminoglycoside Gastrointestinal infections caused by contaminated water or food for example by Salmonella Genitourinary tract infections Healthcareassociated infections that are related to infections from using urinary catheters and that are unresponsive to other medications Otitis media middle ear infection Prophylaxis ie to prevent infection in those who previously had rheumatic heart disease or are undergoing dental procedures vaginal hysterectomies or Csections It is also used in pregnant woman who are carriers of group B streptococci to prevent earlyonset neonatal infections Respiratory infections including bronchitis pharyngitis Sinusitis Sepsis Whooping cough to prevent and treat secondary infections Ampicillin used to also be used to treat gonorrhea but there are now too many strains resistant to penicillins Bacteria Ampicillin is used to treat infections by many grampositive and gramnegative bacteria It was the first broad spectrum penicillin with activity against grampositive bacteria including Streptococcus pneumoniae Streptococcus pyogenes some isolates of Staphylococcus aureus but not penicillinresistant or methicillinresistant strains Trueperella and some Enterococcus It is one of the few antibiotics that works against multidrug resistant Enterococcus faecalis and E faecium Activity against gramnegative bacteria includes Neisseria meningitidis some Haemophilus influenzae and some of the Enterobacteriaceae though most Enterobacteriaceae and Pseudomonas are resistant Its spectrum of activity is enhanced by coadministration of sulbactam a drug that inhibits beta lactamase an enzyme produced by bacteria to inactivate ampicillin and related antibiotics It is sometimes used in combination with other antibiotics that have different mechanisms of action like vancomycin linezolid daptomycin and tigecycline Available forms Ampicillin can be administered by mouth an intramuscular injection shot or by intravenous infusion The oral form available as capsules or oral suspensions is not given as an initial treatment for severe infections but rather as a followup to an IM or IV injection For IV and IM injections ampicillin is kept as a powder that must be reconstituted IV injections must be given slowly as rapid IV injections can lead to convulsive seizures Specific populations Ampicillin is one of the most used drugs in pregnancy and has been found to be generally harmless both by the Food and Drug Administration in the US which classified it as category B and the Therapeutic Goods Administration in Australia which classified it as category A It is the drug of choice for treating Listeria monocytogenes in pregnant women either alone or combined with an aminoglycoside Pregnancy increases the clearance of ampicillin by up to 50 and a higher dose is thus needed to reach therapeutic levels Ampicillin crosses the placenta and remains in the amniotic fluid at 50100 of the concentration in maternal plasma this can lead to high concentrations of ampicillin in the newborn While lactating mothers secrete some ampicillin into their breast milk the amount is minimal In newborns ampicillin has a longer halflife and lower plasma protein binding The clearance by the kidneys is lower as kidney function has not fully developed Contraindications Ampicillin is contraindicated in those with a hypersensitivity to penicillins as they can cause fatal anaphylactic reactions Hypersensitivity reactions can include frequent skin rashes and hives exfoliative dermatitis erythema multiforme and a temporary decrease in both red and white blood cells Ampicillin is not recommended in people with concurrent mononucleosis as over 40 of patients develop a skin rash Side effects Ampicillin is comparatively less toxic than other antibiotics and side effects are more likely in those who are sensitive to penicillins and those with a history of asthma or allergies In very rare cases it causes severe side effects such as angioedema anaphylaxis and C difficile infection that can range from mild diarrhea to serious pseudomembranous colitis Some develop black furry tongue Serious adverse effects also include seizures and serum sickness The most common side effects experienced by about 10 of users are diarrhea and rash Less common side effects can be nausea vomiting itching and blood dyscrasias The gastrointestinal effects such as hairy tongue nausea vomiting diarrhea and colitis are more common with the oral form of penicillin Other conditions may develop up several weeks after treatment Overdose Ampicillin overdose can cause behavioral changes confusion blackouts and convulsions as well as neuromuscular hypersensitivity electrolyte imbalance and kidney failure Interactions Ampicillin reacts with probenecid and methotrexate to decrease renal excretion Large doses of ampicillin can increase the risk of bleeding with concurrent use of warfarin and other oral anticoagulants possibly by inhibiting platelet aggregation Ampicillin has been said to make oral contraceptives less effective but this has been disputed It can be made less effective by other antibiotic such as chloramphenicol erythromycin cephalosporins and tetracyclines For example tetracyclines inhibit protein synthesis in bacteria reducing the target against which ampicillin acts If given at the same time as aminoglycosides it can bind to it and inactivate it When administered separately aminoglycosides and ampicillin can potentiate each other instead Ampicillin causes skin rashes more often when given with allopurinol Both the live.\n",
      "Ceftriaxone sold under the brand name Rocephin is a thirdgeneration cephalosporin antibiotic used for the treatment of a number of bacterial infections These include middle ear infections endocarditis meningitis pneumonia bone and joint infections intraabdominal infections skin infections urinary tract infections gonorrhea and pelvic inflammatory disease It is also sometimes used before surgery and following a bite wound to try to prevent infection Ceftriaxone can be given by injection into a vein or into a muscle Common side effects include pain at the site of injection and allergic reactions Other possible side effects include C difficileassociated diarrhea hemolytic anemia gall bladder disease and seizures It is not recommended in those who have had anaphylaxis to penicillin but may be used in those who have had milder reactions The intravenous form should not be given with intravenous calcium There is tentative evidence that ceftriaxone is relatively safe during pregnancy and breastfeeding It is a thirdgeneration cephalosporin that works by preventing bacteria from making a cell wall Ceftriaxone was patented in 1978 and approved for medical use in 1982 It is on the World Health Organizations List of Essential Medicines It is available as a generic medication Medical use Ceftriaxone and other thirdgeneration cephalosporin antibiotics are used to treat organisms that tend to be resistant to many other antibiotics Due to emergent resistance ceftriaxone should not be used for the treatment of Enterobacter infections Before using ceftriaxone it is important to determine the susceptibility of the bacteria If sepsis is being considered empiric therapy may be initiated prior to susceptibility testing Medical uses include lower respiratory tract infections acute bacterial otitis media skin and skin structure infections urinary tract infections uncomplicated gonorrhea pelvic inflammatory disease bacterial sepsis intraabdominal infections meningitis surgical prophylaxis Lyme disease Ceftriaxone is also a choice drug for treatment of bacterial meningitis caused by pneumococci meningococci Haemophilus influenzae and susceptible enteric Gramnegative rods but not Listeria monocytogenes In combination with doxycycline or azithromycin ceftriaxone used to be recommended by the United States Centers for Disease Control and Prevention CDC for the treatment of uncomplicated gonorrhea Due to increased risk of developing azithromycin resistant strains and the high efficacy of higher doses of ceftriaxone the guidance has been updated to monoantibiotic therapy with a higher dose of ceftriaxone Spectrum of activity Like other thirdgeneration cephalosporins ceftriaxone is active against Citrobacter spp Serratia marcescens and betalactamaseproducing strains of Haemophilus and Neisseria However unlike ceftazidime and cefoperazone ceftriaxone does not have useful activity against Pseudomonas aeruginosa It is generally not active against Enterobacter species and its use should be avoided in the treatment of Enterobacter infections even if the isolate appears susceptible because of the emergence of resistance Some organisms such as Citrobacter Providencia and Serratia have the ability to become resistant through the development of cephalosporinases enzymes that hydrolyze cephalosporins and render them inactive Although not being used as first line therapy against Staphylococcus aureus ceftriaxone retains activity against isolates of methicillinsusceptible S aureus and is used in clinic for infections sustained by this bacterium In this case the dose should be doubled eg 2 g intravenously every 12 hours Available forms Ceftriaxone is available for administration via the intramuscular or the intravenous routes Ceftriaxone is stored as a dry powder in a vial and is reconstituted dissolved immediately before use The solution is used promptly after preparation still reconstituted solutions retain their physical and chemical stability for 24 hours at 25C or for 3 days when stored between 2 and 8C The solutions are pale yellowish in color but the change of color to amber or reddish suggests hydrolysis of the amide bond of the βlactam ring thereby affecting the antimicrobial activity of the antibiotic Diluents containing calcium are not used to reconstitute ceftriaxone and it must not be administered in intravenous lines containing other calciumcontaining solutions as a ceftriaxonecalcium precipitate could form This precipitation risk is particularly high in newborns up to age 28 days especially if they are premature or have impaired bilirubin binding Specific populations Pregnancy Ceftriaxone is pregnancy category B It has not been observed to cause birth defects in animal studies but a lack of wellcontrolled studies done in pregnant women exists Breastfeeding Low concentrations of ceftriaxone are excreted in breast milk that are not expected to cause adverse effects in breastfed infants The manufacturer recommends that caution be exercised when administering ceftriaxone to women who breastfeed Newborns Hyperbilirubinemic neonates are contraindicated for the use of ceftriaxone It can compete with bilirubin and displace it from binding to albumin increasing the risk of bilirubin encephalopathy Elderly According to the package insert clinical studies did not show differences in efficacy and safety of ceftriaxone in geriatrics compared to younger patients but greater sensitivity of some older individuals cannot be ruled out Adverse effects Although generally well tolerated the most common adverse reactions associated with ceftriaxone are changes in white blood cell counts local reactions at site of administration rash and diarrhea Incidence of adverse effects greater than 1 Eosinophilia 6 Thrombocytosis 51 Elevations in liver enzymes 3133 Diarrhea 27 Leukopenia 21 Elevation in BUN 12 Local reactions pain tenderness irritation 1 Rash 17 Some less frequently reported adverse events incidence 1 include phlebitis itchiness fever chills nausea vomiting elevations of bilirubin elevations in creatinine headache and dizziness Ceftriaxone may precipitate in bile causing biliary sludge biliary pseudolithiasis and gallstones especially in children Hypoprothrombinaemia and bleeding are specific side effects Haemolysis is reported It has also been reported to cause post kidney failure in children Like other antibiotics ceftriaxone use can result in Clostridioides difficileassociated diarrhea ranging from mild diarrhea to fatal colitis In this regard it has been reported that shifting from ceftriaxone to cefotaxime would have a lower impact on C difficile infection rates since cefotaxime is almost entirely excreted by the kidneys while ceftriaxone has a 45 biliary excretion Contraindications Ceftriaxone should not be used in those with an allergy to ceftriaxone or any component of the formulation Although there is negligible crossreactivity between.\n",
      "Doxycycline is a broadspectrum antibiotic of the tetracycline class used in the treatment of infections caused by bacteria and certain parasites It is used to treat bacterial pneumonia acne chlamydia infections Lyme disease cholera typhus and syphilis It is also used to prevent malaria Doxycycline may be taken by mouth or by injection into a vein Common side effects include diarrhea nausea vomiting abdominal pain and an increased risk of sunburn Use during pregnancy is not recommended Like other agents of the tetracycline class it either slows or kills bacteria by inhibiting protein production It kills malaria by targeting a plastid organelle the apicoplast Doxycycline was patented in 1957 and came into commercial use in 1967 It is on the World Health Organizations List of Essential Medicines Doxycycline is available as a generic medicine In 2021 it was the 82nd most commonly prescribed medication in the United States with more than 8 million prescriptions Medical uses In addition to the general indications for all members of the tetracycline antibiotics group doxycycline is frequently used to treat Lyme disease chronic prostatitis sinusitis pelvic inflammatory disease severe acne rosacea and rickettsial infections The efficiency of oral doxycycline for treating papulopustular rosacea and adult acne is not solely based on its antibiotic properties but also on its antiinflammatory and antiangiogenic properties In Canada in 2004 doxycycline was considered a firstline treatment for chlamydia and nongonococcal urethritis and with cefixime for uncomplicated gonorrhea Antibacterial General indications Doxycycline is a broadspectrum antibiotic that is employed in the treatment of numerous bacterial infections It is effective against bacteria such as Moraxella catarrhalis Brucella melitensis Chlamydia pneumoniae and Mycoplasma pneumoniae Additionally doxycycline is used in the prevention and treatment of serious conditions like anthrax leptospirosis bubonic plague and Lyme disease However some bacteria including Haemophilus spp Mycoplasma hominis and Pseudomonas aeruginosa have shown resistance to doxycycline It is also effective against Yersinia pestis the infectious agent of bubonic plague and is prescribed for the treatment of Lyme disease ehrlichiosis and Rocky Mountain spotted fever Specifically doxycycline is indicated for treatment of the following diseases Rocky Mountain spotted fever typhus fever and the typhus group scrub typhus Q fever rickettsialpox and tick fevers caused by Rickettsia respiratory tract infections caused by Mycoplasma pneumoniae Lymphogranuloma venereum trachoma inclusion conjunctivitis and uncomplicated urethral endocervical or rectal infections in adults caused by Chlamydia

tularemia cholera campylobacter fetus infections brucellosis caused by Brucella species in conjunction with streptomycin bartonellosis granuloma inguinale Klebsiella species Lyme disease it can be used in adults and children For treatment or prophylaxis of Lyme disease in children it can be used for a duration of up to 21 days in children of any age Doxycycline is specifically indicated to treat Lyme disease for patients presenting with erythema migrans As for the optimal duation of treatment of this disease guidelines vary with some recommending a 10day course of doxycycline while others suggest a 14day course still recent data suggest that even a 7day course of doxycycline can be effective Compared to other drugs there are no significant differences in treatment response across antibiotic agents doses or durations when comparing 14 days versus 21 days as such the optimal duration of treatment of Lyme disease remains uncertain as prolonged antibiotic courses have drawbacks including diminishing returns in terms of patient outcomes heightened risks of adverse events superinfections increased healthcare costs and the potential for development of antibiotic resistance Therefore the consensus remains to treat patients with the shortest effective duration of antibiotics as is the case with doxycycline for Lyme disease as well Gramnegative bacteria specific indications When bacteriologic testing indicates appropriate susceptibility to the drug doxycycline may be used to treat these infections caused by Gramnegative bacteria Escherichia coli infections Enterobacter aerogenes formerly Aerobacter aerogenes infections Shigella species infections Acinetobacter species formerly Mima species and Herellea species infections respiratory tract infections caused by Haemophilus influenzae respiratory tract and urinary tract infections caused by Klebsiella species Grampositive bacteria specific indications Some Grampositive bacteria have developed resistance to doxycycline Up to 44 of Streptococcus pyogenes and up to 74 of S faecalis specimens have developed resistance to the tetracycline group of antibiotics Up to 57 of P acnes strains

      " Ampicillin is an antibiotic belonging to the aminopenicillin class of the penicillin family The drug is used to prevent and treat a number of bacterial infections such as respiratory tract infections urinary tract infections meningitis salmonellosis and endocarditis It may also be used to prevent group B streptococcal infection in newborns It is used by mouth by injection into a muscle or intravenously Common side effects include rash nausea and diarrhea It should not be used in people who are allergic to penicillin Serious side effects may include Clostridium difficile colitis or anaphylaxis While usable in those with kidney problems the dose may need to be decreased Its use during pregnancy and breastfeeding appears to be generally safe Ampicillin was discovered in 1958 and came into commercial use in 1961 It is on the World Health Organizations List of Essential Medicines The World Health Organization classifies ampicillin as critically important for human medicine It is available as a generic medication Medical uses Diseases Bacterial meningitis an aminoglycoside can be added to increase efficacy against gramnegative meningitis bacteria Endocarditis by enterococcal strains offlabel use often given with an aminoglycoside Gastrointestinal infections caused by contaminated water or food for example by Salmonella Genitourinary tract infections Healthcareassociated infections that are related to infections from using urinary catheters and that are unresponsive to other medications Otitis media middle ear infection Prophylaxis ie to prevent infection in those who previously had rheumatic heart disease or are undergoing dental procedures vaginal hysterectomies or Csections It is also used in pregnant woman who are carriers of group B streptococci to prevent earlyonset neonatal infections Respiratory infections including bronchitis pharyngitis Sinusitis Sepsis Whooping cough to prevent and treat secondary infections Ampicillin used to also be used to treat gonorrhea but there are now too many strains resistant to penicillins Bacteria Ampicillin is used to treat infections by many grampositive and gramnegative bacteria It was the first broad spectrum penicillin with activity against grampositive bacteria including Streptococcus pneumoniae Streptococcus pyogenes some isolates of Staphylococcus aureus but not penicillinresistant or methicillinresistant strains Trueperella and some Enterococcus It is one of the few antibiotics that works against multidrug resistant Enterococcus faecalis and E faecium Activity against gramnegative bacteria includes Neisseria meningitidis some Haemophilus influenzae and some of the Enterobacteriaceae though most Enterobacteriaceae and Pseudomonas are resistant Its spectrum of activity is enhanced by coadministration of sulbactam a drug that inhibits beta lactamase an enzyme produced by bacteria to inactivate ampicillin and related antibiotics It is sometimes used in combination with other antibiotics that have different mechanisms of action like vancomycin linezolid daptomycin and tigecycline Available forms Ampicillin can be administered by mouth an intramuscular injection shot or by intravenous infusion The oral form available as capsules or oral suspensions is not given as an initial treatment for severe infections but rather as a followup to an IM or IV injection For IV and IM injections ampicillin is kept as a powder that must be reconstituted IV injections must be given slowly as rapid IV injections can lead to convulsive seizures Specific populations Ampicillin is one of the most used drugs in pregnancy and has been found to be generally harmless both by the Food and Drug Administration in the US which classified it as category B and the Therapeutic Goods Administration in Australia which classified it as category A It is the drug of choice for treating Listeria monocytogenes in pregnant women either alone or combined with an aminoglycoside Pregnancy increases the clearance of ampicillin by up to 50 and a higher dose is thus needed to reach therapeutic levels Ampicillin crosses the placenta and remains in the amniotic fluid at 50100 of the concentration in maternal plasma this can lead to high concentrations of ampicillin in the newborn While lactating mothers secrete some ampicillin into their breast milk the amount is minimal In newborns ampicillin has a longer halflife and lower plasma protein binding The clearance by the kidneys is lower as kidney function has not fully developed Contraindications Ampicillin is contraindicated in those with a hypersensitivity to penicillins as they can cause fatal anaphylactic reactions Hypersensitivity reactions can include frequent skin rashes and hives exfoliative dermatitis erythema multiforme and a temporary decrease in both red and white blood cells Ampicillin is not recommended in people with concurrent mononucleosis as over 40 of patients develop a skin rash Side effects Ampicillin is comparatively less toxic than other antibiotics and side effects are more likely in those who are sensitive to penicillins and those with a history of asthma or allergies In very rare cases it causes severe side effects such as angioedema anaphylaxis and C difficile infection that can range from mild diarrhea to serious pseudomembranous colitis Some develop black furry tongue Serious adverse effects also include seizures and serum sickness The most common side effects experienced by about 10 of users are diarrhea and rash Less common side effects can be nausea vomiting itching and blood dyscrasias The gastrointestinal effects such as hairy tongue nausea vomiting diarrhea and colitis are more common with the oral form of penicillin Other conditions may develop up several weeks after treatment Overdose Ampicillin overdose can cause behavioral changes confusion blackouts and convulsions as well as neuromuscular hypersensitivity electrolyte imbalance and kidney failure Interactions Ampicillin reacts with probenecid and methotrexate to decrease renal excretion Large doses of ampicillin can increase the risk of bleeding with concurrent use of warfarin and other oral anticoagulants possibly by inhibiting platelet aggregation Ampicillin has been said to make oral contraceptives less effective but this has been disputed It can be made less effective by other antibiotic such as chloramphenicol erythromycin cephalosporins and tetracyclines For example tetracyclines inhibit protein synthesis in bacteria reducing the target against which ampicillin acts If given at the same time as aminoglycosides it can bind to it and inactivate it When administered separately aminoglycosides and ampicillin can potentiate each other instead Ampicillin causes skin rashes more often when given with allopurinol Both the live.\n",
      "Ceftriaxone sold under the brand name Rocephin is a thirdgeneration cephalosporin antibiotic used for the treatment of a number of bacterial infections These include middle ear infections endocarditis meningitis pneumonia bone and joint infections intraabdominal infections skin infections urinary tract infections gonorrhea and pelvic inflammatory disease It is also sometimes used before surgery and following a bite wound to try to prevent infection Ceftriaxone can be given by injection into a vein or into a muscle Common side effects include pain at the site of injection and allergic reactions Other possible side effects include C difficileassociated diarrhea hemolytic anemia gall bladder disease and seizures It is not recommended in those who have had anaphylaxis to penicillin but may be used in those who have had milder reactions The intravenous form should not be given with intravenous calcium There is tentative evidence that ceftriaxone is relatively safe during pregnancy and breastfeeding It is a thirdgeneration cephalosporin that works by preventing bacteria from making a cell wall Ceftriaxone was patented in 1978 and approved for medical use in 1982 It is on the World Health Organizations List of Essential Medicines It is available as a generic medication Medical use Ceftriaxone and other thirdgeneration cephalosporin antibiotics are used to treat organisms that tend to be resistant to many other antibiotics Due to emergent resistance ceftriaxone should not be used for the treatment of Enterobacter infections Before using ceftriaxone it is important to determine the susceptibility of the bacteria If sepsis is being considered empiric therapy may be initiated prior to susceptibility testing Medical uses include lower respiratory tract infections acute bacterial otitis media skin and skin structure infections urinary tract infections uncomplicated gonorrhea pelvic inflammatory disease bacterial sepsis intraabdominal infections meningitis surgical prophylaxis Lyme disease Ceftriaxone is also a choice drug for treatment of bacterial meningitis caused by pneumococci meningococci Haemophilus influenzae and susceptible enteric Gramnegative rods but not Listeria monocytogenes In combination with doxycycline or azithromycin ceftriaxone used to be recommended by the United States Centers for Disease Control and Prevention CDC for the treatment of uncomplicated gonorrhea Due to increased risk of developing azithromycin resistant strains and the high efficacy of higher doses of ceftriaxone the guidance has been updated to monoantibiotic therapy with a higher dose of ceftriaxone Spectrum of activity Like other thirdgeneration cephalosporins ceftriaxone is active against Citrobacter spp Serratia marcescens and betalactamaseproducing strains of Haemophilus and Neisseria However unlike ceftazidime and cefoperazone ceftriaxone does not have useful activity against Pseudomonas aeruginosa It is generally not active against Enterobacter species and its use should be avoided in the treatment of Enterobacter infections even if the isolate appears susceptible because of the emergence of resistance Some organisms such as Citrobacter Providencia and Serratia have the ability to become resistant through the development of cephalosporinases enzymes that hydrolyze cephalosporins and render them inactive Although not being used as first line therapy against Staphylococcus aureus ceftriaxone retains activity against isolates of methicillinsusceptible S aureus and is used in clinic for infections sustained by this bacterium In this case the dose should be doubled eg 2 g intravenously every 12 hours Available forms Ceftriaxone is available for administration via the intramuscular or the intravenous routes Ceftriaxone is stored as a dry powder in a vial and is reconstituted dissolved immediately before use The solution is used promptly after preparation still reconstituted solutions retain their physical and chemical stability for 24 hours at 25C or for 3 days when stored between 2 and 8C The solutions are pale yellowish in color but the change of color to amber or reddish suggests hydrolysis of the amide bond of the βlactam ring thereby affecting the antimicrobial activity of the antibiotic Diluents containing calcium are not used to reconstitute ceftriaxone and it must not be administered in intravenous lines containing other calciumcontaining solutions as a ceftriaxonecalcium precipitate could form This precipitation risk is particularly high in newborns up to age 28 days especially if they are premature or have impaired bilirubin binding Specific populations Pregnancy Ceftriaxone is pregnancy category B It has not been observed to cause birth defects in animal studies but a lack of wellcontrolled studies done in pregnant women exists Breastfeeding Low concentrations of ceftriaxone are excreted in breast milk that are not expected to cause adverse effects in breastfed infants The manufacturer recommends that caution be exercised when administering ceftriaxone to women who breastfeed Newborns Hyperbilirubinemic neonates are contraindicated for the use of ceftriaxone It can compete with bilirubin and displace it from binding to albumin increasing the risk of bilirubin encephalopathy Elderly According to the package insert clinical studies did not show differences in efficacy and safety of ceftriaxone in geriatrics compared to younger patients but greater sensitivity of some older individuals cannot be ruled out Adverse effects Although generally well tolerated the most common adverse reactions associated with ceftriaxone are changes in white blood cell counts local reactions at site of administration rash and diarrhea Incidence of adverse effects greater than 1 Eosinophilia 6 Thrombocytosis 51 Elevations in liver enzymes 3133 Diarrhea 27 Leukopenia 21 Elevation in BUN 12 Local reactions pain tenderness irritation 1 Rash 17 Some less frequently reported adverse events incidence 1 include phlebitis itchiness fever chills nausea vomiting elevations of bilirubin elevations in creatinine headache and dizziness Ceftriaxone may precipitate in bile causing biliary sludge biliary pseudolithiasis and gallstones especially in children Hypoprothrombinaemia and bleeding are specific side effects Haemolysis is reported It has also been reported to cause post kidney failure in children Like other antibiotics ceftriaxone use can result in Clostridioides difficileassociated diarrhea ranging from mild diarrhea to fatal colitis In this regard it has been reported that shifting from ceftriaxone to cefotaxime would have a lower impact on C difficile infection rates since cefotaxime is almost entirely excreted by the kidneys while ceftriaxone has a 45 biliary excretion Contraindications Ceftriaxone should not be used in those with an allergy to ceftriaxone or any component of the formulation Although there is negligible crossreactivity between.\n",
      "Doxycycline is a broadspectrum antibiotic of the tetracycline class used in the treatment of infections caused by bacteria and certain parasites It is used to treat bacterial pneumonia acne chlamydia infections Lyme disease cholera typhus and syphilis It is also used to prevent malaria Doxycycline may be taken by mouth or by injection into a vein Common side effects include diarrhea nausea vomiting abdominal pain and an increased risk of sunburn Use during pregnancy is not recommended Like other agents of the tetracycline class it either slows or kills bacteria by inhibiting protein production It kills malaria by targeting a plastid organelle the apicoplast Doxycycline was patented in 1957 and came into commercial use in 1967 It is on the World Health Organizations List of Essential Medicines Doxycycline is available as a generic medicine In 2021 it was the 82nd most commonly prescribed medication in the United States with more than 8 million prescriptions Medical uses In addition to the general indications for all members of the tetracycline antibiotics group doxycycline is frequently used to treat Lyme disease chronic prostatitis sinusitis pelvic inflammatory disease severe acne rosacea and rickettsial infections The efficiency of oral doxycycline for treating papulopustular rosacea and adult acne is not solely based on its antibiotic properties but also on its antiinflammatory and antiangiogenic properties In Canada in 2004 doxycycline was considered a firstline treatment for chlamydia and nongonococcal urethritis and with cefixime for uncomplicated gonorrhea Antibacterial General indications Doxycycline is a broadspectrum antibiotic that is employed in the treatment of numerous bacterial infections It is effective against bacteria such as Moraxella catarrhalis Brucella melitensis Chlamydia pneumoniae and Mycoplasma pneumoniae Additionally doxycycline is used in the prevention and treatment of serious conditions like anthrax leptospirosis bubonic plague and Lyme disease However some bacteria including Haemophilus spp Mycoplasma hominis and Pseudomonas aeruginosa have shown resistance to doxycycline It is also effective against Yersinia pestis the infectious agent of bubonic plague and is prescribed for the treatment of Lyme disease ehrlichiosis and Rocky Mountain spotted fever Specifically doxycycline is indicated for treatment of the following diseases Rocky Mountain spotted fever typhus fever and the typhus group scrub typhus Q fever rickettsialpox and tick fevers caused by Rickettsia respiratory tract infections caused by Mycoplasma pneumoniae Lymphogranuloma venereum trachoma inclusion conjunctivitis and uncomplicated urethral endocervical or rectal infections in adults caused by Chlamydia trachomatis psittacosis nongonococcal urethritis caused by Ureaplasma urealyticum relapsing fever due to Borrelia recurrentis chancroid caused by Haemophilus ducreyi plague due to Yersinia pestis tularemia cholera campylobacter fetus infections brucellosis caused by Brucella species in conjunction with streptomycin bartonellosis granuloma inguinale Klebsiella species Lyme disease it can be used in adults and children For treatment or prophylaxis of Lyme disease in children it can be used for a duration of up to 21 days in children of any age Doxycycline is specifically indicated to treat Lyme disease for patients presenting with erythema migrans As for the optimal duation of treatment of this disease guidelines vary with some recommending a 10day course of doxycycline while others suggest a 14day course still recent data suggest that even a 7day course of doxycycline can be effective Compared to other drugs there are no significant differences in treatment response across antibiotic agents doses or durations when comparing 14 days versus 21 days as such the optimal duration of treatment of Lyme disease remains uncertain as prolonged antibiotic courses have drawbacks including diminishing returns in terms of patient outcomes heightened risks of adverse events superinfections increased healthcare costs and the potential for development of antibiotic resistance Therefore the consensus remains to treat patients with the shortest effective duration of antibiotics as is the case with doxycycline for Lyme disease as well Gramnegative bacteria specific indications When bacteriologic testing indicates appropriate susceptibility to the drug doxycycline may be used to treat these infections caused by Gramnegative bacteria Escherichia coli infections Enterobacter aerogenes formerly Aerobacter aerogenes infections Shigella species infections Acinetobacter species formerly Mima species and Herellea species infections respiratory tract infections caused by Haemophilus influenzae respiratory tract and urinary tract infections caused by Klebsiella species Grampositive bacteria specific indications Some Grampositive bacteria have developed resistance to doxycycline Up to 44 of Streptococcus pyogenes and up to 74 of S faecalis specimens have developed resistance to the tetracycline group of antibiotics Up to 57 of P acnes strains developed resistance to doxycycline When bacteriologic testing indicates appropriate susceptibility to the drug doxycycline may be used to treat these infections caused by Grampositive bacteria upper respiratory infections caused by Streptococcus pneumoniae formerly Diplococcus pneumoniae skin and soft tissue infections caused by Staphylococcus aureus including methicillinresistant Staphylococcus aureus infections anthrax caused by Bacillus anthracis infection Specific applications of doxycycline when penicillin is contraindicated When penicillin is contraindicated doxycycline can be used to treat syphilis caused by Treponema pallidum yaws caused by Treponema pertenue listeriosis due to Listeria monocytogenes Vincents infection caused by Fusobacterium fusiforme actinomycosis caused by Actinomyces israelii infections caused by Clostridium species Use as adjunctive therapy Doxycycline may also be used as adjunctive therapy for severe acne Subantimicrobialdose doxycycline SDD is widely used as an adjunctive treatment to scaling and root planing for periodontitis Significant differences were observed for all investigated clinical parameters of periodontitis in favor of the scaling and root planing SDD group where SDD dosage regimens is 20 mg twice daily for three months in a metaanalysis published in 2011 SDD is also used to treat skin conditions such as acne and rosacea including ocular rosacea In ocular rosacea treatment period is 2 to 3 months After discontinuation of doxycycline recurrences may occur within three months therefore many studies recommend either slow tapering or treatment with a lower dose over a longer period of time Doxycycline is used as an adjunctive therapy for acute intestinal amebiasis Doxycycline is also used as an adjunctive therapy for chancroid As prophylaxis against sexually transmitted infections Doxycycline is used for postexposure prophylaxis PEP to reduce the incidence of bacterial sexually transmitted infections

      "Nitrofurantoin is an antibacterial medication of the nitrofuran class used to treat urinary tract infections although it is not as effective for kidney infections It is taken by mouth Common side effects include nausea loss of appetite diarrhea and headaches Rarely numbness lung problems or liver problems may occur While it appears to be generally safe during pregnancy its use is not recommended near time of delivery While it usually works by slowing bacterial growth it may result in bacterial death at the high concentrations found in urine Nitrofurantoin was first sold in 1953 It is on the World Health Organizations List of Essential Medicines It is available as a generic medication In 2021 it was the 135th most commonly prescribed medication in the United States with more than 4 million prescriptions Medical uses Uses include the treatment of uncomplicated urinary tract infections UTIs and prophylaxis against urinary tract infections in people prone to recurrent urinary tract infections Increasing bacterial antibiotic resistance to other commonly used agents such as trimethoprimsulfamethoxazole and fluoroquinolones has led to increased interest in using nitrofurantoin The efficacy of nitrofurantoin in treating urinary tract infections combined with a low rate of bacterial resistance to this agent makes it one of the firstline agents for treating uncomplicated urinary tract infections as recommended by the Infectious Diseases Society of America and the European Society for Microbiology and Infectious Diseases Nitrofurantoin is not recommended for the treatment of pyelonephritis and intraabdominal abscess because of extremely poor tissue penetration and low blood levels Antibacterial activity Nitrofurantoin has been shown to have good activity against E coli Staphylococcus saprophyticus Coagulase negative staphylococci Enterococcus faecalis Staphylococcus aureus Streptococcus agalactiae Citrobacter species Klebsiella species Bacillus subtilis species It is used in the treatment of infections caused by these organisms Many or all strains of the following genera are resistant to nitrofurantoin Enterobacter Proteus Pseudomonas Special populations Pregnancy Nitrofurantoin is pregnancy category A in Australia It is one of the few drugs commonly used in pregnancy to treat urinary tract infections There is a potential risk of hemolytic anemia in the newborn when used near time of delivery Newborns of women given this drug late in pregnancy had a higher risk of developing neonatal jaundice Evidence of safety in early pregnancy is mixed as of 2017 The American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists states that while they can be used in the first trimester other options may be preferred They remain a first line treatment in the second trimester A 2015 meta analysis found no increased risk from first trimester use in cohort studies that was a slight increase of malformations in case control studies Contraindications Nitrofurantoin is contraindicated in patients with decreased renal function CrCl 60 mlmin due to systemic accumulation and subtherapeutic levels reached in the urinary tract However a retrospective chart review suggests the data for this cutoff are slim and a cutoff of CrCl 40 mlmin would be more appropriate Many of the severe side effects of this drug are more common in the elderly and those with renal impairment as this causes the drug to be retained in the body and reach higher systemic levels Thus the drug is not recommended for the elderly population according to 2012 AGS Beers Criteria Nitrofurantoin is also contraindicated in babies up to the age of one month as they have immature enzyme systems in their red blood cells glutathione instability so nitrofurantoin must not be used because it can cause haemolytic anaemia Nitrofurantoin is contraindicated in patients with glucose6phosphate dehydrogenase deficiency G6PD because of risk of intravascular hemolysis resulting in anemia Adverse effects The most common side effects of nitrofurantoin are nausea headache and flatulence Less common adverse events occurring in less than 1 of those taking the drug include Gastrointestinal diarrhea dyspepsia abdominal pain constipation emesis Neurologic dizziness drowsiness amblyopia Respiratory acute pulmonary hypersensitivity reaction Allergic pruritus urticaria Dermatologic hair loss Miscellaneous fever chills malaise Lung toxicity The pulmonary toxicity caused by nitrofurantoin can be categorized into acute subacute and chronic pulmonary reactions The acute and subacute reactions are thought to be due to a hypersensitivity reaction and often resolve when the drug is discontinued Acute reactions have been estimated to occur in about one in 5000 women who take the drug These reactions usually develop 38 days after the first dose of nitrofurantoin but may occur from a few hours to a few weeks after starting the drug Symptoms include fever dyspnea chills cough pleuritic chest pain headache back pain and epigastric pain Chest radiograph will often show unilateral or bilateral infiltrates similar to pulmonary edema Chronic pulmonary reactions caused by nitrofurantoin include diffuse interstitial pneumonitis pulmonary fibrosis or both This uncommon reaction may occur 1 month to 6 years after starting the drug and is usually related to its total lifetime dose This reaction manifests with progressive shortness of breath It is important to recognize nitrofurantoin as possible cause of symptoms and discontinue the drug when the suspicion of pulmonary side effects arises as it can be reversible if the drug is stopped early Liver toxicity Liver reactions including hepatitis cholestatic jaundice chronic active hepatitis and hepatic necrosis occur rarely Neuropathy Neuropathy is a rare side effect of taking nitrofurantoin Patients may experience numbness and tingling in a stockingglove pattern which may or may not improve upon discontinuation of the drug Pharmacology Organisms are said to be susceptible to nitrofurantoin if their minimum inhibitory concentration is 32 μgmL or less The peak blood concentration of nitrofurantoin following an oral dose of nitrofurantoin 100 mg is less than 1 μgmL and may be undetectable Its bioavailability is about 90 and the urinary excretion is 40 tissue penetration is negligible the drug is well concentrated in the urine 75 of the dose is rapidly metabolised by the liver but 25 of the dose is excreted in the urine unchanged reliably achieving levels of 200 μgmL or more In studies of dogs the majority of urinary excretion is through glomerular filtration with.\n",
